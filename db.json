With this, you can transfer files between your local\ncomputer and the remote host. Even better, you can even edit files or execute\ncommands on the remote host. This guide will explain how to effectively use SSH\nto communicate with another box and how to set up an SSH server so you can SSH\ninto _your_ box.\n\n---\n\nBasic SSH\n---------\n\nIf you are in Windows, download [PuTTy][putty]. To use it, simply type in the\nhost you want to connect to (e.g shell.onid.oregonstate.edu) and open. Sadly,\nthis will be the greatest extent of which you can harness the power of SSH in a\nWindows environment. You can use [PSCP][pscp] to transfer files, but your\npowers here are severly limited.\n\nIf you are on an Android mobile device, install ConnectBot and follow the\nsimilar instructions above. Yup, mobile devices have SSH clients too, cool huh.\n\nLinux and Mac make it really easy for you by having SSH already baked in and\noffers much more flexibility (as usually the case when going with the command\nline).  Let's try it out. Open up a terminal and SSH into a remote host that is\ncurrently running an SSH daemon (server) and which you have access to.\n\n    ~$ ssh [username]@[remote host]:[destination path]\n\nOSU's ONID shell server will serve as a good example. Check out the [OSU Network at\nyour Disposal][resource] guide for more information on what other boxes you\nmay have access to.\n\n    ~$ ssh [username]@shell.onid.oregonstate.edu\n\nAfter authenticating, you should be dropped into a bash shell. Take a moment,\nbreathe, and regain your bearings. Let's try to execute a command.\n\n    [username]@shell:~$ ls\n\nYou should now see all of your files and folders that you have in your home\nfolder on that box. Pretty cool. Now go out and explore. Run wild. Make some\nfolders and edit some files with [vim][].\n\nBasic SCP\n---------\n\nSCP (Secure Copy) is a means of securely transferring files, using the SSH\nprotocol, between two computers. You can transfer a file to a remote host, or\neven transfer a file _from_ a remote host.\n\nTo transfer a file _to_ another box\n\n    ~$ scp [file] [username]@[remote host]:[destination path]\n\nLet's try it out by creating a file and shipping it to the ONID shell server.\n\n    ~$ echo \"hello world!\" > scp_test\n    ~$ scp scp_test [username]@shell.onid.oregonstate.edu:./made_it\n\nIf you wish to know what that first line does, check out our [bash][] guide.\nNotice what we put in the destination path. The `./` means current directory,\nwhich will be your home folder, and `made_it` is what the name of the file will\nbe once it gets there. Let's see our little file made it safely.\n\n    ~$ ssh [username]@shell.onid.oregonstate.edu\n    ~$ less made_it\n\nAnd like magic, we have successfully sent our file out into the world. Look at\nit, living on its own in its own box, all grown up. Just a moment ago, it was a\ntad little file. But we miss it so much, let's get it back.\n\nTo transfer a file _from_ another box\n\n    ~$ scp [username]@[remote host]:[file path] [destination path]\n\nTime to get our little boy back.\n\n    ~$ scp [username]@shell.onid.oregonstate.edu:./made_it ~/Downloads/made_it_back\n    ~$ cd ~/Downloads\n    ~$ less made_it_back\n\nAnd ta-da. Notice how we mixed it up a bit and specified the destination path\nas our Downloads folder. When we send a file to and from a host, we choose\nwhere we want to drop it and specify where it is located respectively. So when\ntransferring a file _from_ another box, it helps to already know where that\nfile is.\n\nSSH Public and Private Keys\n-----------------------\n\nAre you tired of having to enter in your password every time you SSH into\nanother host? Well, wake up! Public-key encryption is a system requiring two\nkeys, one to encrypt plaintext and the other to decrypt plaintext. How\nauthentication works with keys is that you can generate a public key (which\neverybody is allowed to know) and a private key (which is kept secret and\nshould not be given to anybody). You then copy your public key to the other\nhost.  When you try to connect, the server will verify the public key it is\nholding for you against a signature created by your private key. Without your\nprivate key, no one is able to pose as you, which why you never give away your\nprivate key.\n\nTo generate a key pair (public and private key), navigate to your .ssh\ndirectory if you have one or create one with mkdir if you don't.\n\n    ~$ cd ~/.ssh\n    ~$ mkdir ~/.ssh\n\nThen we generate the keys:\n\n    ~$ ssh-keygen -t dsa\n\nIt will prompt you to do stuff. Simply press RETURN over and over until it\nstops bugging you.\n\nAnd copy over your public key to the remote host (again using shell as our\nexample). This command simply appends your public key to your remote host's\nlist of authorized keys. An alternative method is to simply copy your key with\ngedit or vim, and paste the key into ~/.ssh/authorized\\_keys with vim. The\ncommand below makes it much easier however.\n\n    ~$ cat id_dsa.pub | ssh [username]@shell.onid.oregonstate.edu \"cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\"\n\nNow let's see if it worked! SSH into shell and it should not prompt you for a\npassword since it knows who you are now. If it worked, great! If not, feel free\nto ask us in [IRC][irc].\n\nSSH X Forwarding\n----------------\n\nGrowing weary of only talking to another box throw the command line? Well,\nhere's a hit of caffiene! You can actually run programs like Firefox (GUI\nincluded) and use it as if you were running it on your own local computer.\nIt's fairly simple. Just add the -X option. We'll continue to use our shell\nexample.\n\n    ~$ ssh -X [username]@shell.onid.oregonstate.edu\n\nTry running any program. I recommend running it in the background with `&` so\nyou can still use the command line while you click around your GUI.\n\n    ~$ firefox &\n\nSSHD (SSH Server)\n-----------------\n\nTo set up an SSH server, first make sure sshd is installed. This is the daemon that listens for SSH requests. You can install via apt if you are on a Debian-based system and often it will come default.\n\nOnce installed, the default port will be 22. If you want to change the port (in case you have multiple machines with sshd within one network), edit your /etc/ssh/sshd\\_config. Then when you SSH, just add the -p option with the port (ssh -p 2222 [host]).\n\nTry SSHing into your machine. If you are on a home network, get your current NAT IP with ipconfig and try SSHing into that (e.g. ~$ ssh 192.168.1.132). If you want to SSH from outside your network, you need to open up port 22 on your router firewall. This can be done from your router web interface (usually on 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.2.1). The setting for firewall is usually called virtual server, NAT/QoS/ applications and gaming, firewall, or something similar.\n\nI'm sure you are currently on the edge of your seat flailing your arms in\nepiphany.  For your sake, I will refrain from giving you any more information.\nGo, go out! SSH everywhere. The Internet is in an oyster in your hands!\n\n[putty]:http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe\n[pscp]:http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/pscp.exe\n[network]:http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/pscp.exe\n[resources]:/guides/resources/index.html\n[irc]:/guides/irc/index.html\n","source":"_posts/000_ssh.md","raw":"---\ntitle: How to SSH\ntype: blog\ncategory: blog\ndate: 2011-10-23\nid: ssh\ntags: code\n---\n\nSSH is a secure client-server network protocol that allows you to connect with\nanother box (computer).

Let's see our little file made it safely.\n\n    ~$ ssh [username]@shell.onid.oregonstate.edu\n    ~$ less made_it\n\nAnd like magic, we have successfully sent our file out into the world. Look at\nit, living on its own in its own box, all grown up. Just a moment ago, it was a\ntad little file. But we miss it so much, let's get it back.\n\nTo transfer a file _from_ another box\n\n    ~$ scp [username]@[remote host]:[file path] [destination path]\n\nTime to get our little boy back.\n\n    ~$ scp [username]@shell.onid.oregonstate.edu:./made_it ~/Downloads/made_it_back\n    ~$ cd ~/Downloads\n    ~$ less made_it_back\n\nAnd ta-da. Notice how we mixed it up a bit and specified the destination path\nas our Downloads folder. When we send a file to and from a host, we choose\nwhere we want to drop it and specify where it is located respectively. So when\ntransferring a file _from_ another box, it helps to already know where that\nfile is.\n\nSSH Public and Private Keys\n-----------------------\n\nAre you tired of having to enter in your password every time you SSH into\nanother host? Well, wake up! Public-key encryption is a system requiring two\nkeys, one to encrypt plaintext and the other to decrypt plaintext. How\nauthentication works with keys is that you can generate a public key (which\neverybody is allowed to know) and a private key (which is kept secret and\nshould not be given to anybody). You then copy your public key to the other\nhost.  When you try to connect, the server will verify the public key it is\nholding for you against a signature created by your private key. Without your\nprivate key, no one is able to pose as you, which why you never give away your\nprivate key.\n\nTo generate a key pair (public and private key), navigate to your .ssh\ndirectory if you have one or create one with mkdir if you don't.\n\n    ~$ cd ~/.ssh\n    ~$ mkdir ~/.ssh\n\nThen we generate the keys:\n\n    ~$ ssh-keygen -t dsa\n\nIt will prompt you to do stuff. Simply press RETURN over and over until it\nstops bugging you.\n\nAnd copy over your public key to the remote host (again using shell as our\nexample). This command simply appends your public key to your remote host's\nlist of authorized keys. An alternative method is to simply copy your key with\ngedit or vim, and paste the key into ~/.ssh/authorized\\_keys with vim. The\ncommand below makes it much easier however.\n\n    ~$ cat id_dsa.pub | ssh [username]@shell.onid.oregonstate.edu \"cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\"\n\nNow let's see if it worked! SSH into shell and it should not prompt you for a\npassword since it knows who you are now. If it worked, great! If not, feel free\nto ask us in [IRC][irc].\n\nSSH X Forwarding\n----------------\n\nGrowing weary of only talking to another box throw the command line? Well,\nhere's a hit of caffiene! You can actually run programs like Firefox (GUI\nincluded) and use it as if you were running it on your own local computer.\nIt's fairly simple. Just add the -X option. We'll continue to use our shell\nexample.\n\n    ~$ ssh -X [username]@shell.onid.oregonstate.edu\n\nTry running any program. I recommend running it in the background with `&` so\nyou can still use the command line while you click around your GUI.\n\n    ~$ firefox &\n\nSSHD (SSH Server)\n-----------------\n\nTo set up an SSH server, first make sure sshd is installed. This is the daemon that listens for SSH requests. You can install via apt if you are on a Debian-based system and often it will come default.\n\nOnce installed, the default port will be 22. If you want to change the port (in case you have multiple machines with sshd within one network), edit your /etc/ssh/sshd\\_config. Then when you SSH, just add the -p option with the port (ssh -p 2222 [host]).\n\nTry SSHing into your machine. If you are on a home network, get your current NAT IP with ipconfig and try SSHing into that (e.g. ~$ ssh 192.168.1.132). If you want to SSH from outside your network, you need to open up port 22 on your router firewall. This can be done from your router web interface (usually on 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.2.1). The setting for firewall is usually called virtual server, NAT/QoS/ applications and gaming, firewall, or something similar.\n\nI'm sure you are currently on the edge of your seat flailing your arms in\nepiphany.  For your sake, I will refrain from giving you any more information.\nGo, go out! SSH everywhere. The Internet is in an oyster in your hands!\n\n[putty]:http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe\n[pscp]:http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/pscp.exe\n[network]:http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/pscp.exe\n[resources]:/guides/resources/index.html\n[irc]:/guides/irc/index.html\n","slug":"000_ssh","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-24T10:25:46.000Z","_id":"cj4b2m12y0000gyi7oyuag61g","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","content":"<p>SSH is a secure client-server network protocol that allows you to connect with\nanother box (computer).

Why I\nWent With MongoDB:\n\n---\n\n- **flat schema**: the purpose of my project was to dump syslog-ng logs, such\n  as DHCP, NAPT, or VPN logs, into a database for some wicked querying speeds\nthat you just don't get with a flat grep on a file. For this, I didn't need a\nrelational database since the logs are standalone. With the flat schema, I am\nalso able to add in an extra field to the \"schema\" whenever I wanted without\nhaving to go through a month-long migration of hundreds of millions of objects.\n\n- **mmm, json**: from a developer standpoint, JSON is awesome. The dictionary,\n  especially in Python, is my favorite data structure as it makes representing\ndata so easy. It removes the obscurity behind throwing in fields that are\nreferenced by a number and giving it a name. Unline MySQL when you do a\nstandard query and you get back a plain array and have to know which order the\nfields are in, in Mongo, the fields have a name. The JSON allows for very rich\nquery especially with the lovely PyMongo\n\n- **it's hip**: I'll be honest, it's a shiny new toy that deviates from boring,\n  old SQL, but I love playing with it, and initially it was extremely easy\nto set up\n\nNow...I encountered **several problems** while working with this project, but\nmanaged to overcome them with some sysadmin-flavored hot sauce.\n\n- **wtf, global write lock**: yes, whenever there is a write operation sent to\n  the database server, mongod locks down every collection and queues up the\nwrites. I hear they are working on collection-level locking, but I haven't seen\nany of that yet.  This is very bad; in production at work, it is *extremely*\nwrite-heavy, writing hundreds and thousands of logs per second (especially with\nPAT logs for the whole Oregon State University campus, that's 40,000 hosts). In\nabout a week and a half, the database would be approaching **200 million\nobjects**.  But I did find a workaround; I set up a master-slave replicated\ndatabase between two boxes and had the slave be read-only. That way, it is free\nto be read and not to be bogged down with write-locks.

I had to do some housekeeping on our crusty database schema\nusing SQLAlchemy to accomodate a couple of new tables. Now, it was time to\npopulate the new firewall contact information table. A lot of the contact\ninformation could be found on an intranet site in a nice, neat, and most\nimportantly scrapable table. Previously, I had been using either flat regex or\nlxml to scrape web pages, but now it was time to play it smart and have a slurp\nof some [Beautiful Soup](www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), a Python HTML\nparser for screen-scraping.\n\n---\n\nI had heard about Beautiful Soup before, but I had never gotten around to\nactually playing with it.

The information\nwould be able to be viewed from Maintain, Oregon State's DNS/DHCP management\nweb application. I first had to point Maintain towards a new table containing\nVLAN and firewall context pairings that was being populated programmatically\nwhereas the current table containing VLAN information was populated manually.\n\nThere was an issue. A subnet table was pointing to the current VLAN table by\nreferencing its database ID. *cue facepalm*. The decade-old moldy codebase\nstarted to smell yet again. In order to point Maintain to the new table, I had\nto port the subnet table to point towards the VLAN ID rather than a database\nID. I dread being a data entry monkey, so I set off to write a script to port\nthe data.

Before I started\nworking on it several months ago, I had little Javascript experience. I had\nonly done a tiny jQuery-UI paginator and some exercises from Crockford's\n\"Javascript: The Good Parts\" and [Eloquent\nJavascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net). There were two motivations behind\nbuilding my own image gallery. First, it would be cool and I could use it to\npost pictures to perhaps show my family what I've been up to since I'm all\ngrown-up and rarely home. Secondly, I really needed to level up my Javascript\nskills Rocky-style before I headed down to Mozilla for a web development\ninternship.  What use is a web developer that doesn't know Javascript?\n\nI started the trek into what I called \"Javascript: The Final Frontier\", a\nmission to explore Javascript, to seek out new technologies, and to go where\nmost web devs have gone before.

They let me import\nmusic to a consolidated library folder, edit ID3 tags and update the file, and\nfetch album art. However, managing it through a GUI very quickly became\ntedious.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"http://github.com/ngokevin/mp3-Suite\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">bot</a> that fetched music from\n<a href=\"reddit.com/r/listentothis\">/r/listentothis</a> was grabbing anywhere from 20 to\n30 songs a day on a cron. Since they were being fetched from YouTube via\nyoutube-dl, the songs were untagged. After a while, the songs build up, and I\nget hundreds or even thousands of songs that are left sitting in my library\nuntagged. I only wanted to tag songs that I liked which entailed sifting\nthrough them. Ideally, I would want to be able to listen to my music\nlibrary from anywhere (e.g. work) and slowly tag or delete songs remotely.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Depending on managing my music on my desktop with Banshee was difficult:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>My desktop is usually off so I can’t remote into it to actually manage my library.</li>\n<li>Banshee is difficult to use remotely because it is very resource-intensive</li>\n<li>It being a GUI made it not very efficient actions-per-minute wise</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I depended too much on Banshee, and needed a command-line alternative.

It's been a year since I started working at OSU's Network\nEngineering Team ([NET][net]) as a programmer, and I have few words (mostly\nhappy swearing) to say how awesome it's been. I'd probably be lying face-down\nin in some ditch somewhere had I not been hired. I've met many smart people,\npicked up the art of hacking, been within three feet of Linus Torvalds, and\nnabbed an internship at Mozilla. NET is one of the sweetest places to work on\ncampus, heck I'd might even work for free (don't tell my bosses).\n\n## What is NET?\n\nNET \"provides data hosting, networking, phone services, and conferencing\nsolutions for the OSU community\". Basically, NET keeps OSU's network beating.\nEvery time there's slow Internet, NET lubes it up. And every time there's\noutage or attack, NET is on the scene. Without NET, students would not be able\nto log onto Facebook. Oh, the tragedy. NET runs about three data centers on\ncampus, two of which are in Kerr, with another data center on the way (plopping\nit right on top of some farmland).\n\nI heard about the opening at NET from [uberj](uberj) who had already been\nworking there. I told him, \"I'm a pleb! I need to find a job and become\nawesome\". Funny thing, uberj was my TA for a freshman CS course that I was taking\nduring my second year.  We were in the same classes and that I was browsing a\ncertain social news website. Lucky, had I taken that course as a freshman like\neveryone else, tested out of it, or had I not been browsing Reddit, I'd be\nprobably be in that ditch I mentioned earlier.  Or maybe perhaps I would have\nwon the lottery.\n\n## Interview and Offer\n\nI was interviewed by three people, two bouses and a student.  At that point, I\nhadn't realized that it was actually a programming job. Unfortunately, I acted\nas if I was interviewing for a helpdesk job. The best things I had programmed\nat the time were a lame network chat client, lame network tic-tac-toe game, a\nlame (and broken) DNS client, and some programming challenges. All I knew was C\nand Java, and their language was Python. I could program, but not towards\nanything practically useful (thanks OSU for teaching me how to draw smiley\nfaces in Java). Though I wanted to learn, and I had a black belt in Google-Fu\n(yeah, that was on my resume). Apparently, that was enough.\n\nSurprisingly, I found out I got the job via email one day while I was lounging\naround during spring break. I had been trying to step my game up and was in the\nmiddle of programming a heads-up poker system in Java (my secret first GitHub\nproject). I dropped that pretty quickly. I look back at this job offer along\nwith my Ford Family Foundation scholarship and upcoming Mozilla internship, and\nI think how extremely lucky to float life like this.\n\n## First Days\n\nIt was that sunny time of year fitting for shorts and polos. I buzzed into the\nloud humming of the data center, and walked into a small quieter room within\nthe data center to meet my co-workers. Four people sat in front of long desk\nthat ran around the edges of the room. It was sort of a really cool\nhackerspace. Not sure if I was ready for this. I went to introduce myself to\none of the guys. He stares at me for a bit and turns away. He turns back around\nwith a small scratch pad, \"my name is David, welcome to NET bro!\". uberj turns\naround and tells me that he's mute. \"Oh...nice to meet you\", I say sort of\nsurprisingly. He wasn't mute. All of while this is happening, limed, the boss,\nis shaking is head disapprovingly at the massive trolling. It really was\n'welcome to NET, bro'.\n\nI did not set too good of an impression showing up very late for work the next\ncouple of days by oversleeping past noon. New hires are kept on sort of a\ntighter leash to...prevent certain repeatings of history.\n\nNow let me do my Charles Dickens impression. Walking through the data center\ninto the office was nostalgic. The hums and fans of the data center were loud,\nbut calming like white noise, and it would muffle as I closed the door behind\nme into the office. I would buy a breakfast burrito and Arizona iced tea to\nstart the day at 8am. I'd be the first one in, munching on my burrito and\nlistening to VLC streaming music from my server in the dorms. Then\n[thedjpetersen][thedjpetersen] would walk in later and we'd peacefully code\naway.\n\n## Learning Python and Django\n\nThe days when I didn't know Python, the concept of a web framework, or even\nHTML, those days were the dark ages. I started the lurk-and-learn phase of any\nnew programming hire. I'd silently read over our codebase, maybe ask the\noccasional question. It was a \"figure it out yourself, read the docs\" kind of\nplace, easily enough that's what I had always done. I read over [Learn Python\nthe Hard Way][learnpython], [Dive Into Python][dive], The Definitive Guide to\nDjango, and watched the [Google Python Classes][pygoog]. There weren't any\nprojects for me to do yet, so I just used my downtime wisely.\n\nthedjpetersen, who sat next to me, was working on a Django web application for\nmanaging DMCA takedown notifications. This would later become my adopted child,\nnamed **Banhammer**. Banhammer was only the frontend, the backend was a suite\nof scripts which we named **Supergruntmaster9000** after a Dilbert strip. I\nwould also later help in raising this child as well. One day, he gave me a\nsmall checklist of things that needed to be done for the site, to keep me busy.\nThey were to make form fields persist after submitting, adding a field to a\nform, and humanizing a form field. Now I had never done anything on the web\nbesides make stuff blink nor had I imagined I would ever become entangled in\nthe web (see what I did there?).\n\nWell after a day or two, I actually finished these tasks, to my own awe. It\nrequired some minimal understanding of MVC frameworks and Django templates, but\ndamn was I proud. After that, I fixed the search functions by hacking on\n[Haystack][haystack] for a while, which felt monumental. From there, I just did\nmore and more stuff, absorbing knowledge from thedjpetersen through osmosis. I\ncontinued to help build the web application (which would become quite a\nlong-term thing with a larger scope). I adopted a set of Python scripts that,\ngiven search parameters, parsed massive network logs to track down hosts and\ndid some hacking on that.\n\n## The Lonely Summer\n\nThen as summer rolled around, everyone vanished. Everyone either graduated\nor got internships and jobs somewhere else. After about two months, I became\nthe senior (and only) student manning the battle-stations. To keep myself from\nbecoming lonely and from growing insane, I constructed cardboard/whiteboard\nversions of all of my former coworkers to converse with. We had some good\ntimes, right, guys? Right...? Okay, they were a bit quiet and stiff, but at\nleast I had the OSL developers to talk to. Right, guys? Right...? :(\n\nWell, at least I became so focused, I was practically vomiting code. I passed\nall previous NET students in number of commits in about four months (I am\nCommit King). I refactored and revamped all of the code to shiny new heights,\nadded features like a boss, and tore down tickets like a madman. I started my\nown project, MongoDB network log dumping and searching with a Django web\napplication which I worked on for a couple of months and is just now seeing\nthe light of day. I named it netshed.\n\nIt was a fun and sunny summer filled with Steam games, coding, going to the\ngym, and LinuxCon. The college town of Corvallis, usually swarmed by students,\nwas not swarmed by students. uberj soon came back to NET, and fall term was\nrollin' round. There were now only two NET students, what used to be five. We\nneeded some more firepower.\n\n## Being the Hirer and the Hiree\n\nWe spent several weeks racking a stack of resumes for new student hires, and\nthen the interview gauntlet began. Over the course of a few days, we\ninterviewed about 7-8 students. I even had to awkwardly interview the person\nwho I had previously got the job over. Now, that doesn't happen everyday. We\npicked up fridgei, who I had met on IRC where we talked about coding and poker\nand a murrown, a robotics guy with some sought-after skills in Python. I\npreviously went more in-depth on what it's like to\n[interview](/blog/interviewing) others in my position as a student.\n\nAround the same time, I myself was being interviewed by Mozilla, going through\na [series of three interviews](/blog/20111109-mozilla/). Talk about being\non both sides of the table.\n\n## Cyder, the Future\n\nI haven't talked about this much, mostly because I try to actively repress it\n(with some help of medication), but I worked on a PHP web application called\nMaintain. I said PHP so you might know where this is going. Maintain is used on\nOSU to register hosts and devices onto the network and manage DNS and DHCP. It\nwas written almost ten years ago in a homegrown PHP \"framework\". The code is\nactually almost as ugly as the frontend which consists of tables all the way\ndown, strewn in obnoxious shades of black and orange. Now, to be fair, this\nwas ten years ago when the concept of a web framework was new and the Internet\nwas a wild west. To be even more fair, it works very well (though it has some\ninherent flaws in its schema for DNS). It has the right idea with managing DNS\nthrough a web application in front of a database that pushes out to a\nnameserver. But it's aging, and not like wine.\n\nWe talked to OSU Central Web Services, a Rails shop, to perhaps contract them\nto build it. They went through some meetings. In the end, our budget and their\navailability became an issue. So why not save $500,000 and have us students\nbuild it. We have the skills, we have the technology, and we're relatively\ndirt-cheap.\n\nuberj began to plan out the schema, set up the models, wrote many tests while I\nfocused more on school. We named it [cyder][cyder], a play on CIDR and a\nfollowing of the recent trend of naming web applications after alcoholic drinks\nhere. It was a bit rough getting each other into each other's workflows. I had\nworked at NET for almost year, but we actually never really worked together.\nBut thanks to Git branches and with him doing mostly backend and me doing more\nfrontend, we got into the flow. And to this date, we're still working on it.\nWe've had a whole month of downtime, waiting to move to California, so Cyder\nhas become a full-time thing. What's cool is we could probably make it our\nsenior engineering project.

It's been a year since I started working at OSU's Network\nEngineering Team ([NET][net]) as a programmer, and I have few words (mostly\nhappy swearing) to say how awesome it's been. I'd probably be lying face-down\nin in some ditch somewhere had I not been hired. I've met many smart people,\npicked up the art of hacking, been within three feet of Linus Torvalds, and\nnabbed an internship at Mozilla. NET is one of the sweetest places to work on\ncampus, heck I'd might even work for free (don't tell my bosses).\n\n## What is NET?\n\nNET \"provides data hosting, networking, phone services, and conferencing\nsolutions for the OSU community\". Basically, NET keeps OSU's network beating.\nEvery time there's slow Internet, NET lubes it up. And every time there's\noutage or attack, NET is on the scene. Without NET, students would not be able\nto log onto Facebook. Oh, the tragedy. NET runs about three data centers on\ncampus, two of which are in Kerr, with another data center on the way (plopping\nit right on top of some farmland).\n\nI heard about the opening at NET from [uberj](uberj) who had already been\nworking there. I told him, \"I'm a pleb! I need to find a job and become\nawesome\". Funny thing, uberj was my TA for a freshman CS course that I was taking\nduring my second year.  We were in the same classes and that I was browsing a\ncertain social news website. Lucky, had I taken that course as a freshman like\neveryone else, tested out of it, or had I not been browsing Reddit, I'd be\nprobably be in that ditch I mentioned earlier.  Or maybe perhaps I would have\nwon the lottery.\n\n## Interview and Offer\n\nI was interviewed by three people, two bouses and a student.  At that point, I\nhadn't realized that it was actually a programming job. Unfortunately, I acted\nas if I was interviewing for a helpdesk job. The best things I had programmed\nat the time were a lame network chat client, lame network tic-tac-toe game, a\nlame (and broken) DNS client, and some programming challenges. All I knew was C\nand Java, and their language was Python. I could program, but not towards\nanything practically useful (thanks OSU for teaching me how to draw smiley\nfaces in Java). Though I wanted to learn, and I had a black belt in Google-Fu\n(yeah, that was on my resume). Apparently, that was enough.\n\nSurprisingly, I found out I got the job via email one day while I was lounging\naround during spring break. I had been trying to step my game up and was in the\nmiddle of programming a heads-up poker system in Java (my secret first GitHub\nproject). I dropped that pretty quickly. I look back at this job offer along\nwith my Ford Family Foundation scholarship and upcoming Mozilla internship, and\nI think how extremely lucky to float life like this.\n\n## First Days\n\nIt was that sunny time of year fitting for shorts and polos. I buzzed into the\nloud humming of the data center, and walked into a small quieter room within\nthe data center to meet my co-workers. Four people sat in front of long desk\nthat ran around the edges of the room. It was sort of a really cool\nhackerspace. Not sure if I was ready for this. I went to introduce myself to\none of the guys. He stares at me for a bit and turns away. He turns back around\nwith a small scratch pad, \"my name is David, welcome to NET bro!\". uberj turns\naround and tells me that he's mute. \"Oh...nice to meet you\", I say sort of\nsurprisingly. He wasn't mute. All of while this is happening, limed, the boss,\nis shaking is head disapprovingly at the massive trolling. It really was\n'welcome to NET, bro'.\n\nI did not set too good of an impression showing up very late for work the next\ncouple of days by oversleeping past noon. New hires are kept on sort of a\ntighter leash to...prevent certain repeatings of history.\n\nNow let me do my Charles Dickens impression. Walking through the data center\ninto the office was nostalgic. The hums and fans of the data center were loud,\nbut calming like white noise, and it would muffle as I closed the door behind\nme into the office. I would buy a breakfast burrito and Arizona iced tea to\nstart the day at 8am. I'd be the first one in, munching on my burrito and\nlistening to VLC streaming music from my server in the dorms. Then\n[thedjpetersen][thedjpetersen] would walk in later and we'd peacefully code\naway.\n\n## Learning Python and Django\n\nThe days when I didn't know Python, the concept of a web framework, or even\nHTML, those days were the dark ages. I started the lurk-and-learn phase of any\nnew programming hire. I'd silently read over our codebase, maybe ask the\noccasional question. It was a \"figure it out yourself, read the docs\" kind of\nplace, easily enough that's what I had always done. I read over [Learn Python\nthe Hard Way][learnpython], [Dive Into Python][dive], The Definitive Guide to\nDjango, and watched the [Google Python Classes][pygoog]. There weren't any\nprojects for me to do yet, so I just used my downtime wisely.\n\nthedjpetersen, who sat next to me, was working on a Django web application for\nmanaging DMCA takedown notifications. This would later become my adopted child,\nnamed **Banhammer**. Banhammer was only the frontend, the backend was a suite\nof scripts which we named **Supergruntmaster9000** after a Dilbert strip. I\nwould also later help in raising this child as well. One day, he gave me a\nsmall checklist of things that needed to be done for the site, to keep me busy.\nThey were to make form fields persist after submitting, adding a field to a\nform, and humanizing a form field. Now I had never done anything on the web\nbesides make stuff blink nor had I imagined I would ever become entangled in\nthe web (see what I did there?).\n\nWell after a day or two, I actually finished these tasks, to my own awe. It\nrequired some minimal understanding of MVC frameworks and Django templates, but\ndamn was I proud. After that, I fixed the search functions by hacking on\n[Haystack][haystack] for a while, which felt monumental. From there, I just did\nmore and more stuff, absorbing knowledge from thedjpetersen through osmosis. I\ncontinued to help build the web application (which would become quite a\nlong-term thing with a larger scope). I adopted a set of Python scripts that,\ngiven search parameters, parsed massive network logs to track down hosts and\ndid some hacking on that.\n\n## The Lonely Summer\n\nThen as summer rolled around, everyone vanished. Everyone either graduated\nor got internships and jobs somewhere else. After about two months, I became\nthe senior (and only) student manning the battle-stations. To keep myself from\nbecoming lonely and from growing insane, I constructed cardboard/whiteboard\nversions of all of my former coworkers to converse with. We had some good\ntimes, right, guys? Right...? Okay, they were a bit quiet and stiff, but at\nleast I had the OSL developers to talk to. Right, guys? Right...? :(\n\nWell, at least I became so focused, I was practically vomiting code. I passed\nall previous NET students in number of commits in about four months (I am\nCommit King). I refactored and revamped all of the code to shiny new heights,\nadded features like a boss, and tore down tickets like a madman. I started my\nown project, MongoDB network log dumping and searching with a Django web\napplication which I worked on for a couple of months and is just now seeing\nthe light of day. I named it netshed.\n\nIt was a fun and sunny summer filled with Steam games, coding, going to the\ngym, and LinuxCon. The college town of Corvallis, usually swarmed by students,\nwas not swarmed by students. uberj soon came back to NET, and fall term was\nrollin' round. There were now only two NET students, what used to be five. We\nneeded some more firepower.\n\n## Being the Hirer and the Hiree\n\nWe spent several weeks racking a stack of resumes for new student hires, and\nthen the interview gauntlet began. Over the course of a few days, we\ninterviewed about 7-8 students. I even had to awkwardly interview the person\nwho I had previously got the job over. Now, that doesn't happen everyday. We\npicked up fridgei, who I had met on IRC where we talked about coding and poker\nand a murrown, a robotics guy with some sought-after skills in Python. I\npreviously went more in-depth on what it's like to\n[interview](/blog/interviewing) others in my position as a student.\n\nAround the same time, I myself was being interviewed by Mozilla, going through\na [series of three interviews](/blog/20111109-mozilla/). Talk about being\non both sides of the table.\n\n## Cyder, the Future\n\nI haven't talked about this much, mostly because I try to actively repress it\n(with some help of medication), but I worked on a PHP web application called\nMaintain. I said PHP so you might know where this is going. Maintain is used on\nOSU to register hosts and devices onto the network and manage DNS and DHCP. It\nwas written almost ten years ago in a homegrown PHP \"framework\". The code is\nactually almost as ugly as the frontend which consists of tables all the way\ndown, strewn in obnoxious shades of black and orange. Now, to be fair, this\nwas ten years ago when the concept of a web framework was new and the Internet\nwas a wild west. To be even more fair, it works very well (though it has some\ninherent flaws in its schema for DNS). It has the right idea with managing DNS\nthrough a web application in front of a database that pushes out to a\nnameserver. But it's aging, and not like wine.\n\nWe talked to OSU Central Web Services, a Rails shop, to perhaps contract them\nto build it. They went through some meetings. In the end, our budget and their\navailability became an issue. So why not save $500,000 and have us students\nbuild it. We have the skills, we have the technology, and we're relatively\ndirt-cheap.\n\nuberj began to plan out the schema, set up the models, wrote many tests while I\nfocused more on school. We named it [cyder][cyder], a play on CIDR and a\nfollowing of the recent trend of naming web applications after alcoholic drinks\nhere. It was a bit rough getting each other into each other's workflows. I had\nworked at NET for almost year, but we actually never really worked together.\nBut thanks to Git branches and with him doing mostly backend and me doing more\nfrontend, we got into the flow. And to this date, we're still working on it.\nWe've had a whole month of downtime, waiting to move to California, so Cyder\nhas become a full-time thing. What's cool is we could probably make it our\nsenior engineering project. I will talk more about the project in later blog\npost about Django class-based generic views and Jinja2 template inheritance.\n\nThanks to limed, peterkir, chapmant, uberj for getting me into NET and thanks\nto thedjpetersen for teaching me stuff. And thanks to fridgei and murrown for\nadopting my babies, netshed and banhammer, they have found good homes.

It really was\n‘welcome to NET, bro’.</p>\n<p>I did not set too good of an impression showing up very late for work the next\ncouple of days by oversleeping past noon. New hires are kept on sort of a\ntighter leash to…prevent certain repeatings of history.</p>\n<p>Now let me do my Charles Dickens impression. Walking through the data center\ninto the office was nostalgic. The hums and fans of the data center were loud,\nbut calming like white noise, and it would muffle as I closed the door behind\nme into the office. I would buy a breakfast burrito and Arizona iced tea to\nstart the day at 8am. I’d be the first one in, munching on my burrito and\nlistening to VLC streaming music from my server in the dorms. Then\n<a href=\"http://thedjpetersen.github.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">thedjpetersen</a> would walk in later and we’d peacefully code\naway.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Learning-Python-and-Django\"><a href=\"#Learning-Python-and-Django\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Learning Python and Django\"></a>Learning Python and Django</h2><p>The days when I didn’t know Python, the concept of a web framework, or even\nHTML, those days were the dark ages. I started the lurk-and-learn phase of any\nnew programming hire. I’d silently read over our codebase, maybe ask the\noccasional question. It was a “figure it out yourself, read the docs” kind of\nplace, easily enough that’s what I had always done. I read over <a href=\"http://learnpythonthehardway.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Learn Python\nthe Hard Way</a>, <a href=\"http://diveintopython.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Dive Into Python</a>, The Definitive Guide to\nDjango, and watched the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKTZoB2Vjuk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Google Python Classes</a>. There weren’t any\nprojects for me to do yet, so I just used my downtime wisely.</p>\n<p>thedjpetersen, who sat next to me, was working on a Django web application for\nmanaging DMCA takedown notifications. This would later become my adopted child,\nnamed <strong>Banhammer</strong>. Banhammer was only the frontend, the backend was a suite\nof scripts which we named <strong>Supergruntmaster9000</strong> after a Dilbert strip. I\nwould also later help in raising this child as well. One day, he gave me a\nsmall checklist of things that needed to be done for the site, to keep me busy.\nThey were to make form fields persist after submitting, adding a field to a\nform, and humanizing a form field. Now I had never done anything on the web\nbesides make stuff blink nor had I imagined I would ever become entangled in\nthe web (see what I did there?).</p>\n<p>Well after a day or two, I actually finished these tasks, to my own awe. It\nrequired some minimal understanding of MVC frameworks and Django templates, but\ndamn was I proud. After that, I fixed the search functions by hacking on\n<a href=\"http://haystacksearch.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Haystack</a> for a while, which felt monumental. From there, I just did\nmore and more stuff, absorbing knowledge from thedjpetersen through osmosis. I\ncontinued to help build the web application (which would become quite a\nlong-term thing with a larger scope). I adopted a set of Python scripts that,\ngiven search parameters, parsed massive network logs to track down hosts and\ndid some hacking on that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The-Lonely-Summer\"><a href=\"#The-Lonely-Summer\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Lonely Summer\"></a>The Lonely Summer</h2><p>Then as summer rolled around, everyone vanished. Everyone either graduated\nor got internships and jobs somewhere else. After about two months, I became\nthe senior (and only) student manning the battle-stations. To keep myself from\nbecoming lonely and from growing insane, I constructed cardboard/whiteboard\nversions of all of my former coworkers to converse with. We had some good\ntimes, right, guys? Right…? Okay, they were a bit quiet and stiff, but at\nleast I had the OSL developers to talk to. Right, guys? Right…? :(</p>\n<p>Well, at least I became so focused, I was practically vomiting code. I passed\nall previous NET students in number of commits in about four months (I am\nCommit King). I refactored and revamped all of the code to shiny new heights,\nadded features like a boss, and tore down tickets like a madman. I started my\nown project, MongoDB network log dumping and searching with a Django web\napplication which I worked on for a couple of months and is just now seeing\nthe light of day. I named it netshed.</p>\n<p>It was a fun and sunny summer filled with Steam games, coding, going to the\ngym, and LinuxCon. The college town of Corvallis, usually swarmed by students,\nwas not swarmed by students. uberj soon came back to NET, and fall term was\nrollin’ round. There were now only two NET students, what used to be five. We\nneeded some more firepower.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Being-the-Hirer-and-the-Hiree\"><a href=\"#Being-the-Hirer-and-the-Hiree\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Being the Hirer and the Hiree\"></a>Being the Hirer and the Hiree</h2><p>We spent several weeks racking a stack of resumes for new student hires, and\nthen the interview gauntlet began. Over the course of a few days, we\ninterviewed about 7-8 students. I even had to awkwardly interview the person\nwho I had previously got the job over. Now, that doesn’t happen everyday. We\npicked up fridgei, who I had met on IRC where we talked about coding and poker\nand a murrown, a robotics guy with some sought-after skills in Python. I\npreviously went more in-depth on what it’s like to\n<a href=\"/blog/interviewing\">interview</a> others in my position as a student.</p>\n<p>Around the same time, I myself was being interviewed by Mozilla, going through\na <a href=\"/blog/20111109-mozilla/\">series of three interviews</a>. Talk about being\non both sides of the table.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Cyder-the-Future\"><a href=\"#Cyder-the-Future\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Cyder, the Future\"></a>Cyder, the Future</h2><p>I haven’t talked about this much, mostly because I try to actively repress it\n(with some help of medication), but I worked on a PHP web application called\nMaintain. I said PHP so you might know where this is going. Maintain is used on\nOSU to register hosts and devices onto the network and manage DNS and DHCP. It\nwas written almost ten years ago in a homegrown PHP “framework”. The code is\nactually almost as ugly as the frontend which consists of tables all the way\ndown, strewn in obnoxious shades of black and orange. Now, to be fair, this\nwas ten years ago when the concept of a web framework was new and the Internet\nwas a wild west. To be even more fair, it works very well (though it has some\ninherent flaws in its schema for DNS). It has the right idea with managing DNS\nthrough a web application in front of a database that pushes out to a\nnameserver. But it’s aging, and not like wine.</p>\n<p>We talked to OSU Central Web Services, a Rails shop, to perhaps contract them\nto build it. They went through some meetings. In the end, our budget and their\navailability became an issue. So why not save $500,000 and have us students\nbuild it. We have the skills, we have the technology, and we’re relatively\ndirt-cheap.</p>\n<p>uberj began to plan out the schema, set up the models, wrote many tests while I\nfocused more on school. We named it <a href=\"http://github.com/uberj/cyder/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">cyder</a>, a play on CIDR and a\nfollowing of the recent trend of naming web applications after alcoholic drinks\nhere. It was a bit rough getting each other into each other’s workflows. I had\nworked at NET for almost year, but we actually never really worked together.\nBut thanks to Git branches and with him doing mostly backend and me doing more\nfrontend, we got into the flow. And to this date, we’re still working on it.\nWe’ve had a whole month of downtime, waiting to move to California, so Cyder\nhas become a full-time thing. What’s cool is we could probably make it our\nsenior engineering project. I will talk more about the project in later blog\npost about Django class-based generic views and Jinja2 template inheritance.</p>\n<p>Thanks to limed, peterkir, chapmant, uberj for getting me into NET and thanks\nto thedjpetersen for teaching me stuff. And thanks to fridgei and murrown for\nadopting my babies, netshed and banhammer, they have found good homes. Woop\nwoop.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/fQNUQ.gif\"></p>\n"},{"title":"Simple CSS3 - Transitions and Transforms","type":"blog","date":"2012-03-25T07:00:00.000Z","id":"css3","_content":"\nToday, I created CSS3 hover effects for my [contact](contact) page.

But I have been burning through my list of bugs with Marketplace Beta\nlaunching today, and my body is sore from straight days of basketball,\nlifting, and tennis. So now is as good of a time as any to write.\n\n---\n\nI'll be explaining how the statistics dashboard for Mozilla Marketplace.\nMarketplace is Mozilla's app store meant to support their mobile operating\nsystem, Boot2Gecko. What's unique about Marketplace is that the apps are\nsimple webapps (HTML/CSS/JS) and is thus platform and device independent. Apps\ncan be installed on any OS, any browser, any device. Developers are no longer\ntied to a specific programming language (Java/Obj-C) and app store\n(Android/iOS). I'll be explaining how it currently works and be talking about\nwhat it was like to work on it.\n\n## Statistics Dashboard\n\nA *statistics dashboard* is a page that displays data in the form of graphs,\ncharts, and tables with controls to change what data is displayed. An example\nis Google Analytics which gives information about a website's hits. This helps\nusers know how well their site is doing, what kinds of people are visiting,\nand what they do during their visit. The landing dashboard shows hits over\ntime along with a table with aggregated stats.\n\n<img src=\"http://imgur.com/xJh8Z.jpg\"/>\n\nFor Marketplace, the statistics dashboard should let developers know how well\ntheir apps are doing, where their purchases are coming from, and how much bank\nthey are making. For the dashboard, we want to precalculate the data so it\ndoesn't have to get calculated every time a user pulls up the dashboard since\ntht would be slow. Thus we store the data in a data store beforehand,\ncalculating it daily.\n\n## An Analogy\n\nKevin is a boy who likes to play with toys. To get toys, Kevin has to go to\nthe toy store, but the toy store is far away. It doesn't make sense to have to\ngo to the toy store every time Kevin wants to play with toys. Not only that, he\nhas to spend time in the toy store looking for what he wants. So instead he\ngoes to buy toys every day after school and puts it in his drawer. He\ncategorizes different types of toys into different drawers so he can quickly\nlocate his desired toys. Now every time he wants to play with a certain toy,\nhe doesn't have to go all the way to the toy store, find the toy, and bring it\nhome. He can just go to his drawer.\n\nHere's the part where I explain the analogy. Kevin represents a user of\nMarketplace who wants to pull up certain data (toys) from the statistics\ndashboard. The slow way to do it would be to ask the database (toy store) for\ndata which is represented by the time it takes to get to the toy store. Once\nthe data is handed over from the database, calculations has to be done to it\nto get the desired metric of data we want, which is represented by the time it\ntakes Kevin to find his toy in the toy store. Instead, we do everything at\nonce beforehand (every day after school) by grabbing data from the database\n(toy store), performing aggregations (finding the toy), and storing it into\nthe datastore (a certain drawer). Then whenever a user hits the page, time\nisn't wasted going to the database every time. Because the task of calculating\ndata beforehand is done asynchronously (in the background), users don't\nexperience any slowness. Kevin is free to play with his toys on demand.\n\n## How It Really Works\n\nThe stack consists of Python in the backend (and Django as the web framework),\n[highcharts.js](http://highcharts.com) for the frontend, and ElasticSearch\nacting as a key-value store (drawer). The inital codebase was copied over from\nMozilla's [add-ons](http://addons.mozilla.org) site.\nThe backend's duty is to pull objects from the database (toy store), perform aggregations, and store the aggregations into ElasticSearch, which\nis all done asynchronously in the backend as a cron job (task set to\nrun at a regular interval, like an alarm clock). The frontend's duty is to\nquery (ask for data) ElasticSearch for the already aggregated data and\ndisplay it with highcharts.js, a graphing library (set of tools to create\ncharts).\n\nLet's say we want to display the number of an app's sales per day as a line\ngraph.  Our desired metric is sales per day. We don't want to calculate\ndata for already calculated days since that would be a waste of computing\npower. So we grab the newest object from ElasticSearch, check its date and\ntime, and then we know where to start from.\n\nFirst we have to write an **indexer**. It first pulls payment objects, or\npurchase records, from the database that are later than the newest object\nfrom ElasticSearch. We check a purchase record's date, say 'oh, we need to\ncalculate the sales per day for that date', and count the number of\npurchase records during that day. This counting functionality is provided\nby the database (or rather Django's ORM). We package some data together\ninto a 'document' and store it into ElasticSearch. The document needs more\nthan just the number of sales for that date we just calculated, we need to\nbe able to associate it with certain values (categorize the toy) to know\nhow to pull back out later. Values we need to attach to the count include\nthe app's id (like a social security number) and the for which date the\ncount represents.\n\nSo the data is stored, the toy is in the drawer ready to be played with.\nThe data sits there until it is needed when a user visits an app's\nstatistics page. This is where the **frontend** comes in. When a user visits\nthe statistics page, a template page (HTML/CSS) is loaded with no graphs or\ntables yet. It just contains things like a header and links. Django, the\nweb framework, handles this part, and the rest is up to Javascript. Space\nis left in the page for a graph and table, which Javascript populates.\n\nThe Javascript code makes a request to the web server with a standard URL\n(like how you would request Facebook's page with facebook.com). The URL has\nparameters attached to it which tells the server what kind of data it\nwants.

So now is as good of a time as any to write.\n\n---\n\nI'll be explaining how the statistics dashboard for Mozilla Marketplace.\nMarketplace is Mozilla's app store meant to support their mobile operating\nsystem, Boot2Gecko. What's unique about Marketplace is that the apps are\nsimple webapps (HTML/CSS/JS) and is thus platform and device independent. Apps\ncan be installed on any OS, any browser, any device. Developers are no longer\ntied to a specific programming language (Java/Obj-C) and app store\n(Android/iOS). I'll be explaining how it currently works and be talking about\nwhat it was like to work on it.\n\n## Statistics Dashboard\n\nA *statistics dashboard* is a page that displays data in the form of graphs,\ncharts, and tables with controls to change what data is displayed. An example\nis Google Analytics which gives information about a website's hits. This helps\nusers know how well their site is doing, what kinds of people are visiting,\nand what they do during their visit. The landing dashboard shows hits over\ntime along with a table with aggregated stats.\n\n<img src=\"http://imgur.com/xJh8Z.jpg\"/>\n\nFor Marketplace, the statistics dashboard should let developers know how well\ntheir apps are doing, where their purchases are coming from, and how much bank\nthey are making. For the dashboard, we want to precalculate the data so it\ndoesn't have to get calculated every time a user pulls up the dashboard since\ntht would be slow. Thus we store the data in a data store beforehand,\ncalculating it daily.\n\n## An Analogy\n\nKevin is a boy who likes to play with toys. To get toys, Kevin has to go to\nthe toy store, but the toy store is far away. It doesn't make sense to have to\ngo to the toy store every time Kevin wants to play with toys. Not only that, he\nhas to spend time in the toy store looking for what he wants. So instead he\ngoes to buy toys every day after school and puts it in his drawer. He\ncategorizes different types of toys into different drawers so he can quickly\nlocate his desired toys. Now every time he wants to play with a certain toy,\nhe doesn't have to go all the way to the toy store, find the toy, and bring it\nhome. He can just go to his drawer.\n\nHere's the part where I explain the analogy. Kevin represents a user of\nMarketplace who wants to pull up certain data (toys) from the statistics\ndashboard. The slow way to do it would be to ask the database (toy store) for\ndata which is represented by the time it takes to get to the toy store. Once\nthe data is handed over from the database, calculations has to be done to it\nto get the desired metric of data we want, which is represented by the time it\ntakes Kevin to find his toy in the toy store. Instead, we do everything at\nonce beforehand (every day after school) by grabbing data from the database\n(toy store), performing aggregations (finding the toy), and storing it into\nthe datastore (a certain drawer). Then whenever a user hits the page, time\nisn't wasted going to the database every time. Because the task of calculating\ndata beforehand is done asynchronously (in the background), users don't\nexperience any slowness. Kevin is free to play with his toys on demand.\n\n## How It Really Works\n\nThe stack consists of Python in the backend (and Django as the web framework),\n[highcharts.js](http://highcharts.com) for the frontend, and ElasticSearch\nacting as a key-value store (drawer). The inital codebase was copied over from\nMozilla's [add-ons](http://addons.mozilla.org) site.\nThe backend's duty is to pull objects from the database (toy store), perform aggregations, and store the aggregations into ElasticSearch, which\nis all done asynchronously in the backend as a cron job (task set to\nrun at a regular interval, like an alarm clock). The frontend's duty is to\nquery (ask for data) ElasticSearch for the already aggregated data and\ndisplay it with highcharts.js, a graphing library (set of tools to create\ncharts).\n\nLet's say we want to display the number of an app's sales per day as a line\ngraph.  Our desired metric is sales per day. We don't want to calculate\ndata for already calculated days since that would be a waste of computing\npower. So we grab the newest object from ElasticSearch, check its date and\ntime, and then we know where to start from.\n\nFirst we have to write an **indexer**. It first pulls payment objects, or\npurchase records, from the database that are later than the newest object\nfrom ElasticSearch. We check a purchase record's date, say 'oh, we need to\ncalculate the sales per day for that date', and count the number of\npurchase records during that day. This counting functionality is provided\nby the database (or rather Django's ORM). We package some data together\ninto a 'document' and store it into ElasticSearch. The document needs more\nthan just the number of sales for that date we just calculated, we need to\nbe able to associate it with certain values (categorize the toy) to know\nhow to pull back out later. Values we need to attach to the count include\nthe app's id (like a social security number) and the for which date the\ncount represents.\n\nSo the data is stored, the toy is in the drawer ready to be played with.\nThe data sits there until it is needed when a user visits an app's\nstatistics page. This is where the **frontend** comes in. When a user visits\nthe statistics page, a template page (HTML/CSS) is loaded with no graphs or\ntables yet. It just contains things like a header and links. Django, the\nweb framework, handles this part, and the rest is up to Javascript. Space\nis left in the page for a graph and table, which Javascript populates.\n\nThe Javascript code makes a request to the web server with a standard URL\n(like how you would request Facebook's page with facebook.com). The URL has\nparameters attached to it which tells the server what kind of data it\nwants. The server catches the request, queries ElasticSearch for the data,\nand responds with data (in the form of JSON or XML). This process is called\n**AJAX**, where Javascript makes a request by itself client-side (from the\nbrowser), a request separate from the loading of the initial page. So the\nJavascript grabs the data from the server's response, passes it to our\ngraphing library (highcharts) which creates pretty graphs for us. The data\nis cached into local storage so reloading the page doesn't make another\nredundant request to the web server.

Because the task of calculating\ndata beforehand is done asynchronously (in the background), users don’t\nexperience any slowness. Kevin is free to play with his toys on demand.</p>\n<h2 id=\"How-It-Really-Works\"><a href=\"#How-It-Really-Works\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How It Really Works\"></a>How It Really Works</h2><p>The stack consists of Python in the backend (and Django as the web framework),\n<a href=\"http://highcharts.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">highcharts.js</a> for the frontend, and ElasticSearch\nacting as a key-value store (drawer). The inital codebase was copied over from\nMozilla’s <a href=\"http://addons.mozilla.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">add-ons</a> site.\nThe backend’s duty is to pull objects from the database (toy store), perform aggregations, and store the aggregations into ElasticSearch, which\nis all done asynchronously in the backend as a cron job (task set to\nrun at a regular interval, like an alarm clock). The frontend’s duty is to\nquery (ask for data) ElasticSearch for the already aggregated data and\ndisplay it with highcharts.js, a graphing library (set of tools to create\ncharts).</p>\n<p>Let’s say we want to display the number of an app’s sales per day as a line\ngraph.  Our desired metric is sales per day. We don’t want to calculate\ndata for already calculated days since that would be a waste of computing\npower. So we grab the newest object from ElasticSearch, check its date and\ntime, and then we know where to start from.</p>\n<p>First we have to write an <strong>indexer</strong>. It first pulls payment objects, or\npurchase records, from the database that are later than the newest object\nfrom ElasticSearch. We check a purchase record’s date, say ‘oh, we need to\ncalculate the sales per day for that date’, and count the number of\npurchase records during that day. This counting functionality is provided\nby the database (or rather Django’s ORM). We package some data together\ninto a ‘document’ and store it into ElasticSearch. The document needs more\nthan just the number of sales for that date we just calculated, we need to\nbe able to associate it with certain values (categorize the toy) to know\nhow to pull back out later. Values we need to attach to the count include\nthe app’s id (like a social security number) and the for which date the\ncount represents.</p>\n<p>So the data is stored, the toy is in the drawer ready to be played with.\nThe data sits there until it is needed when a user visits an app’s\nstatistics page. This is where the <strong>frontend</strong> comes in. When a user visits\nthe statistics page, a template page (HTML/CSS) is loaded with no graphs or\ntables yet. It just contains things like a header and links. Django, the\nweb framework, handles this part, and the rest is up to Javascript. Space\nis left in the page for a graph and table, which Javascript populates.</p>\n<p>The Javascript code makes a request to the web server with a standard URL\n(like how you would request Facebook’s page with facebook.com). The URL has\nparameters attached to it which tells the server what kind of data it\nwants. The server catches the request, queries ElasticSearch for the data,\nand responds with data (in the form of JSON or XML). This process is called\n<strong>AJAX</strong>, where Javascript makes a request by itself client-side (from the\nbrowser), a request separate from the loading of the initial page. So the\nJavascript grabs the data from the server’s response, passes it to our\ngraphing library (highcharts) which creates pretty graphs for us. The data\nis cached into local storage so reloading the page doesn’t make another\nredundant request to the web server. And that’s it from a heuristic level,\nwe have pretty data!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://imgur.com/5eAjA.jpg\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"Thoughts-on-Working-on-It\"><a href=\"#Thoughts-on-Working-on-It\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Thoughts on Working on It\"></a>Thoughts on Working on It</h2><p>I’ll start with the basic workflow. My <a href=\"http://github.com/cvan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">mentor</a> or\nweb QA breaks down the whole statistics project into small bug tickets or\ntasks to make it easy to manage. I choose a bug to work on, ordered by\npriority, create a Git branch just for that bug, and then write code (and\ntests for that code). I make a lot of local Git commits, which I squash\ninto one commit for the bug. I ask for a code review, usually from my\nmentor, then I make revisions to my code based on comments from the code\nreview until the code is cleared for take-off. I merge the code into my\nmaster branch and push it to the central Mozilla repository for the\nMarketplace project.</p>\n<p>I grokked the codebase pretty quickly, but there were things that gave me a\nlot of trouble and have eaten up many of my hours. The main culprit was\nElasticSearch. How the hell does ElasticSearch work? Who knows. <strong>Data comes\nin, data goes out,</strong> <a href=\"http://http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bill-oreilly-you-cant-explain-that\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\"><strong>you can’t\nexplain that</strong></a>.\nThe documentation isn’t very helpful and there wasn’t documentation for\nElasticSearch for the Marketplace project. It’s very difficult to debug\nsince it’s a big black box. There was a difficult hurdle where\nElasticSearch stored my data as lower-case and tokenizes strings on\nhyphens. I spent a solid day figuring out where I put in ‘Cat’, ask for\n‘Cat’, and get nothing without any traceback. I had to keep putting in\ndifferent inputs to see what worked. Only recently did I learn about\nsetting up ElasticSearch mappings, which is similar to setting up Django\nmodels. ElasticSearch runs analyzers and tokenizers apparently, and I had\nto specify fields to not be analyzed. I think I developed a rash on my head\nfrom so much head-scratching. 0.0?</p>\n<p>Other difficulties…Working on fifteen different files at once, all being\ntouched across five different active branches can get somewhat confusing.\nDebugging Django reverse URLs is a !@#$% when you got 50 URLs each with\nfive or six parameters, and the order at which you define them can mess\nthings up.</p>\n<p>Takeaways. Experience on grokking and working on another codebase, some Git\nskills, things to add to my inner coding style guide, yet another reminder how\nuseful tests are, Django reverse URLs skills, working in a different workflow,\nand some pride being given the go-ahead to write something to be seen by tens\nof millions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Final-Thoughts\"><a href=\"#Final-Thoughts\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Final Thoughts\"></a>Final Thoughts</h2><p>After this, I’ll be working on porting Mozilla themes (previously called\nPersonas) to Marketplace. Upcoming blog posts in mind include talking about\nwhat the open web is and Mozilla’s genuine mission to forward the web. A few\nhackathons coming up, expect some webapps to be churned out and featured here.</p>\n<p>Apart from that, life is awesome. Learning lots. Everyday, I get to do what I\nenjoy all day surrounded by many cool people and go home to do more things I\nenjoy. I live next to basketball/tennis courts, pool/hot tub, gym, and I’m\nfeeling healthy. Food (and Vitamin waters) are plentiful and free. Hell, I’m\npretty much saving up for retirement now since I got everything I need. Watched\nthe NBA Finals and play Halo on a giant 110-inch screen at the office. Former\nboss just got hired to Mozilla, I wouldn’t be here if I hadn’t been working at\n<a href=\"http://ngokevin.com/blog/net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">NET</a>. Just got off a little\n<a href=\"http://ngokevin.com/gallery/mountainview-june\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">vacation</a> with my family and\nmany more fun things to expect for the summer (woo, kayaking).  And Silicon\nValley is nice and sunny, clear skies ahead.</p>\n"},{"title":"First Day At Mozilla","type":"blog","date":"2012-04-30T07:00:00.000Z","id":"mozilla-day-one","image":{"url":"http://i.imgur.com/11CEg.jpg","where":"right"},"_content":"\nToday, I began my internship at Mozilla.

Into d3.js","type":"blog","date":"2012-03-26T07:00:00.000Z","id":"d3","_content":"\nToday, I started experimenting with d3.js. A fortune-teller hinted to me that\nI would be doing a lot of data visualization work in the near-future and that\nd3.js would come in handy. Since my grades for last term just came out today,\nI figured graphing my GPA over the last three years would be a nice toy\nstart. It would also be a nice visualization for me to reflect on the last\nthree years since I'm done with school for the next six months.\n\n## What is d3.js?\n\nd3.js is a small Javascript library for 'manipulating documents based on\ndata'. d3 stands for *data-driven documents*. More specifically, d3.js is\nused to bind data and apply *data-driven transformations* to DOM elements.\nHowever, it is not a visualization framework loaded with visualization\nfunctions. It is more of a tool that focuses on efficient manipulation of\ndocuments based on data.

The documentation explains\neverything in better detail, but for a 'case study' let's build a simple GPA\nbar chart. First, we need to define our data.\n\n    ::javascript\n    var gpa_term_data = [\n    {'term': 'F09', 'gpa': 3.40},\n    {'term': 'W10', 'gpa': 3.32},\n    {'term': 'S10', 'gpa': 3.56},\n\n    {'term': 'F10', 'gpa': 3.32},\n    {'term': 'W11', 'gpa': 3.57},\n    {'term': 'S11', 'gpa': 3.71},\n\n    {'term': 'F11', 'gpa': 3.72},\n    {'term': 'W12', 'gpa': 3.92},\n    ];\n\nIn this case, we want GPA by term. So we create a list of objects holding the\ndata. Next, we'll set up the chart itself, its size, position, and scales.\n\n    ::javascript\n    var barWidth = 70;\n    var chartWidth = (barWidth + 10) * gpa_term_data.length;\n    var chartHeight = 200;\n    var padding = 20;\n\n    // scales\n    var xScale = d3.scale.linear().\n        domain([0, gpa_term_data.length]).\n        range([0, chartWidth]);\n\n    var yScale = d3.scale.linear().\n        domain([3, d3.max(gpa_term_data, function(datum) {\n            return datum.gpa;\n        })]).\n        range([0, chartHeight]);\n\nd3 has scale functions that return functions. In our definition, the domain\nis about the data, and the range is more about the number of pixels the data\nis mapped to. For X, the domain is are the terms and for Y, the domain is the\nGPA. We'll only care about GPA over 3.0 so we set the minimum as such. We\nhave the domain map to the range linearly, and we can use the returned\nfunction to help position data around the chart. Next we'll create the actual\nbars.\n\n    ::javascript\n    // create rectangle for each datum\n    chart.selectAll('rect').\n        data(gpa_term_data).\n        enter().\n        append('svg:rect').\n        attr('x', function(datum, index) {\n            // return x-offset pixels\n            return xScale(index);\n        }).\n        attr('y', function(datum) {\n            // return y-offset pixels, subtract due to origin being in top left\n            return chartHeight - yScale(datum.gpa);\n        }).\n        attr('height', function(datum) {\n            return yScale(datum.gpa);\n        }).\n        attr('width', barWidth).\n        attr('fill', '#2d578b');\n\nHere, we use a common pattern, *selectAll.data.enter.append*. selectAll\nselects all elements that match (like jQuery), here we select SVG rectangles,\nbut we haven't created any rectangles yet. Well if we use *data()* and pass in\nour data, we can create them on-the-fly. When we pass in data that don't have\nany elements to bind to, the data is considered leftover and is stored in the\n*enter selection*. So the data isn't binded yet, but if we call *enter()*,\nenter will take all the leftover data and automatically create elements out\nof them. We are thus effectively binding our data to rectangle elements,\n**the heart of d3.js!**. There is a function called *exit()* that does the\nopposite, remove elements that don't have any data binded, but it isn't used\nhere. Finally, actually create and append the elements onto the chart.\n\nWhile we're creating the rectangles, we specify their size and position. We\nmake use of Javascript anonymous functions which d3 expects to take a *datum*\nand an optional *index* argument. The datum is the data binded to the element\nand the index is the, well, index among the data set. For the x-position, we\ncall our scale function we created earlier to get the pixel offset. We do\nsimilar for y, but since the coordinate system features the origin on the\ntop-left, we subtract it from the chartHeight. The height of the bar is set\nto be the GPA, and that's the meat of it.\n\nWe do similar things to position the axes and text (check the source of this\npage to see) except we have to pad the chart to make room for the axes. We\neventually have the finished bar chart.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n<div id=\"chart\"></div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n// define data\nvar gpa_term_data = [\n    {'term': 'F09', 'gpa': 3.40},\n    {'term': 'W10', 'gpa': 3.32},\n    {'term': 'S10', 'gpa': 3.56},\n\n    {'term': 'F10', 'gpa': 3.32},\n    {'term': 'W11', 'gpa': 3.57},\n    {'term': 'S11', 'gpa': 3.71},\n\n    {'term': 'F11', 'gpa': 3.72},\n    {'term': 'W12', 'gpa': 3.92},\n];\n\nvar barWidth = 70;\nvar chartWidth = (barWidth + 10) * gpa_term_data.length;\nvar chartHeight = 200;\nvar padding = 20;\n\n// scales\nvar xScale = d3.scale.linear().\n    domain([0, gpa_term_data.length]).\n    range([0, chartWidth]);\n\nvar yScale = d3.scale.linear().\n    domain([3, d3.max(gpa_term_data, function(datum) {\n        return datum.gpa;\n    })]).\n    range([0, chartHeight]);\n\n// create canvas\nvar chart = d3.select('#chart').\n    append('svg:svg').\n    attr('width', chartWidth).\n    attr('height', chartHeight + padding);\n\n// create rectangle for each datum\nchart.selectAll('rect').\n    data(gpa_term_data).\n    enter().\n    append('svg:rect').\n    attr('x', function(datum, index) {\n        // return x-offset pixels\n        return xScale(index);\n    }).\n    attr('y', function(datum) {\n        // return y-offset pixels, subtract due to origin being in top left\n        return chartHeight - yScale(datum.gpa);\n    }).\n    attr('height', function(datum) {\n        return yScale(datum.gpa);\n    }).\n    attr('width', barWidth).\n    attr('fill', '#2d578b');\n\n// text\nchart.selectAll('text').\n    data(gpa_term_data).\n    enter().\n    append('svg:text').\n    text(function(datum) {\n        return datum.gpa;\n    }).\n    attr('x', function(datum, index) {\n        return xScale(index) + barWidth / 2;\n    }).\n    attr('y', function(datum) {\n        return chartHeight - yScale(datum.gpa);\n    }).\n    attr('dy', '1.2em'). // y padding\n    attr('text-anchor', 'middle').\n    attr('fill', 'white').\n    attr(\"style\", \"font-size: 12; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif\");\n\n// X axis text\nchart.selectAll('text.xAxis').\n    data(gpa_term_data).\n    enter().\n    append('svg:text').\n    attr('class', 'xAxis').\n    text(function(datum) {\n        return datum.term;\n    }).\n    attr('x', function(datum, index) {\n        return xScale(index) + barWidth / 2;\n    }).\n    attr('y', chartHeight + padding).\n    attr('text-anchor', 'middle').\n    attr(\"style\", \"font-size: 12; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif\");\n\n// chart label\nchart.append('svg:text').\n    attr('class', 'label').\n    text('GPA by Term').\n    attr('x', 0).\n    attr('y', 15);\n</script>\n\n<br/>\nOver the next few days, I'll be doing more things with d3.js.

Into d3.js\"\ntype: blog\ncategory: blog\ndate: 2012-03-26\nid: \"d3\"\ntags: code\n---\n\nToday, I started experimenting with d3.js. A fortune-teller hinted to me that\nI would be doing a lot of data visualization work in the near-future and that\nd3.js would come in handy. Since my grades for last term just came out today,\nI figured graphing my GPA over the last three years would be a nice toy\nstart. It would also be a nice visualization for me to reflect on the last\nthree years since I'm done with school for the next six months.\n\n## What is d3.js?\n\nd3.js is a small Javascript library for 'manipulating documents based on\ndata'. d3 stands for *data-driven documents*. More specifically, d3.js is\nused to bind data and apply *data-driven transformations* to DOM elements.\nHowever, it is not a visualization framework loaded with visualization\nfunctions. It is more of a tool that focuses on efficient manipulation of\ndocuments based on data. Because it's simply a tool, it can be used to build\nwhatever kind of data visualizations or graphs needed.\n\n---\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://mbostock.github.com/d3/d3.js\"></script>\n\n## Let's draw a useless circle\n\nd3 makes it easy to add SVG elements and manipulate them with its\njQuery-esque method chaining.

The documentation explains\neverything in better detail, but for a ‘case study’ let’s build a simple GPA\nbar chart. First, we need to define our data.</p>\n<pre><code>::javascript\nvar gpa_term_data = [\n{&apos;term&apos;: &apos;F09&apos;, &apos;gpa&apos;: 3.40},\n{&apos;term&apos;: &apos;W10&apos;, &apos;gpa&apos;: 3.32},\n{&apos;term&apos;: &apos;S10&apos;, &apos;gpa&apos;: 3.56},\n\n{&apos;term&apos;: &apos;F10&apos;, &apos;gpa&apos;: 3.32},\n{&apos;term&apos;: &apos;W11&apos;, &apos;gpa&apos;: 3.57},\n{&apos;term&apos;: &apos;S11&apos;, &apos;gpa&apos;: 3.71},\n\n{&apos;term&apos;: &apos;F11&apos;, &apos;gpa&apos;: 3.72},\n{&apos;term&apos;: &apos;W12&apos;, &apos;gpa&apos;: 3.92},\n];\n</code></pre><p>In this case, we want GPA by term. So we create a list of objects holding the\ndata. Next, we’ll set up the chart itself, its size, position, and scales.</p>\n<pre><code>::javascript\nvar barWidth = 70;\nvar chartWidth = (barWidth + 10) * gpa_term_data.length;\nvar chartHeight = 200;\nvar padding = 20;\n\n// scales\nvar xScale = d3.scale.linear().\n    domain([0, gpa_term_data.length]).\n    range([0, chartWidth]);\n\nvar yScale = d3.scale.linear().\n    domain([3, d3.max(gpa_term_data, function(datum) {\n        return datum.gpa;\n    })]).\n    range([0, chartHeight]);\n</code></pre><p>d3 has scale functions that return functions. In our definition, the domain\nis about the data, and the range is more about the number of pixels the data\nis mapped to. For X, the domain is are the terms and for Y, the domain is the\nGPA. We’ll only care about GPA over 3.0 so we set the minimum as such. We\nhave the domain map to the range linearly, and we can use the returned\nfunction to help position data around the chart. Next we’ll create the actual\nbars.</p>\n<pre><code>::javascript\n// create rectangle for each datum\nchart.selectAll(&apos;rect&apos;).\n    data(gpa_term_data).\n    enter().\n    append(&apos;svg:rect&apos;).\n    attr(&apos;x&apos;, function(datum, index) {\n        // return x-offset pixels\n        return xScale(index);\n    }).\n    attr(&apos;y&apos;, function(datum) {\n        // return y-offset pixels, subtract due to origin being in top left\n        return chartHeight - yScale(datum.gpa);\n    }).\n    attr(&apos;height&apos;, function(datum) {\n        return yScale(datum.gpa);\n    }).\n    attr(&apos;width&apos;, barWidth).\n    attr(&apos;fill&apos;, &apos;#2d578b&apos;);\n</code></pre><p>Here, we use a common pattern, <em>selectAll.data.enter.append</em>. selectAll\nselects all elements that match (like jQuery), here we select SVG rectangles,\nbut we haven’t created any rectangles yet. Well if we use <em>data()</em> and pass in\nour data, we can create them on-the-fly. When we pass in data that don’t have\nany elements to bind to, the data is considered leftover and is stored in the\n<em>enter selection</em>. So the data isn’t binded yet, but if we call <em>enter()</em>,\nenter will take all the leftover data and automatically create elements out\nof them. We are thus effectively binding our data to rectangle elements,\n<strong>the heart of d3.js!</strong>. There is a function called <em>exit()</em> that does the\nopposite, remove elements that don’t have any data binded, but it isn’t used\nhere. Finally, actually create and append the elements onto the chart.</p>\n<p>While we’re creating the rectangles, we specify their size and position. We\nmake use of Javascript anonymous functions which d3 expects to take a <em>datum</em>\nand an optional <em>index</em> argument. The datum is the data binded to the element\nand the index is the, well, index among the data set. For the x-position, we\ncall our scale function we created earlier to get the pixel offset. We do\nsimilar for y, but since the coordinate system features the origin on the\ntop-left, we subtract it from the chartHeight. The height of the bar is set\nto be the GPA, and that’s the meat of it.</p>\n<p>We do similar things to position the axes and text (check the source of this\npage to see) except we have to pad the chart to make room for the axes.

First, we need to define our data.</p>\n<pre><code>::javascript\nvar gpa_term_data = [\n{&apos;term&apos;: &apos;F09&apos;, &apos;gpa&apos;: 3.40},\n{&apos;term&apos;: &apos;W10&apos;, &apos;gpa&apos;: 3.32},\n{&apos;term&apos;: &apos;S10&apos;, &apos;gpa&apos;: 3.56},\n\n{&apos;term&apos;: &apos;F10&apos;, &apos;gpa&apos;: 3.32},\n{&apos;term&apos;: &apos;W11&apos;, &apos;gpa&apos;: 3.57},\n{&apos;term&apos;: &apos;S11&apos;, &apos;gpa&apos;: 3.71},\n\n{&apos;term&apos;: &apos;F11&apos;, &apos;gpa&apos;: 3.72},\n{&apos;term&apos;: &apos;W12&apos;, &apos;gpa&apos;: 3.92},\n];\n</code></pre><p>In this case, we want GPA by term. So we create a list of objects holding the\ndata. Next, we’ll set up the chart itself, its size, position, and scales.</p>\n<pre><code>::javascript\nvar barWidth = 70;\nvar chartWidth = (barWidth + 10) * gpa_term_data.length;\nvar chartHeight = 200;\nvar padding = 20;\n\n// scales\nvar xScale = d3.scale.linear().\n    domain([0, gpa_term_data.length]).\n    range([0, chartWidth]);\n\nvar yScale = d3.scale.linear().\n    domain([3, d3.max(gpa_term_data, function(datum) {\n        return datum.gpa;\n    })]).\n    range([0, chartHeight]);\n</code></pre><p>d3 has scale functions that return functions. In our definition, the domain\nis about the data, and the range is more about the number of pixels the data\nis mapped to. For X, the domain is are the terms and for Y, the domain is the\nGPA. We’ll only care about GPA over 3.0 so we set the minimum as such. We\nhave the domain map to the range linearly, and we can use the returned\nfunction to help position data around the chart. Next we’ll create the actual\nbars.</p>\n<pre><code>::javascript\n// create rectangle for each datum\nchart.selectAll(&apos;rect&apos;).\n    data(gpa_term_data).\n    enter().\n    append(&apos;svg:rect&apos;).\n    attr(&apos;x&apos;, function(datum, index) {\n        // return x-offset pixels\n        return xScale(index);\n    }).\n    attr(&apos;y&apos;, function(datum) {\n        // return y-offset pixels, subtract due to origin being in top left\n        return chartHeight - yScale(datum.gpa);\n    }).\n    attr(&apos;height&apos;, function(datum) {\n        return yScale(datum.gpa);\n    }).\n    attr(&apos;width&apos;, barWidth).\n    attr(&apos;fill&apos;, &apos;#2d578b&apos;);\n</code></pre><p>Here, we use a common pattern, <em>selectAll.data.enter.append</em>. selectAll\nselects all elements that match (like jQuery), here we select SVG rectangles,\nbut we haven’t created any rectangles yet. Well if we use <em>data()</em> and pass in\nour data, we can create them on-the-fly. When we pass in data that don’t have\nany elements to bind to, the data is considered leftover and is stored in the\n<em>enter selection</em>. So the data isn’t binded yet, but if we call <em>enter()</em>,\nenter will take all the leftover data and automatically create elements out\nof them. We are thus effectively binding our data to rectangle elements,\n<strong>the heart of d3.js!</strong>. There is a function called <em>exit()</em> that does the\nopposite, remove elements that don’t have any data binded, but it isn’t used\nhere. Finally, actually create and append the elements onto the chart.</p>\n<p>While we’re creating the rectangles, we specify their size and position. We\nmake use of Javascript anonymous functions which d3 expects to take a <em>datum</em>\nand an optional <em>index</em> argument. The datum is the data binded to the element\nand the index is the, well, index among the data set. For the x-position, we\ncall our scale function we created earlier to get the pixel offset. We do\nsimilar for y, but since the coordinate system features the origin on the\ntop-left, we subtract it from the chartHeight. The height of the bar is set\nto be the GPA, and that’s the meat of it.</p>\n<p>We do similar things to position the axes and text (check the source of this\npage to see) except we have to pad the chart to make room for the axes. We\neventually have the finished bar chart.\n<br>\n<br></p>\n<p><div id=\"chart\"></div></p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n// define data\nvar gpa_term_data = [\n    {'term': 'F09', 'gpa': 3.40},\n    {'term': 'W10', 'gpa': 3.32},\n    {'term': 'S10', 'gpa': 3.56},\n\n    {'term': 'F10', 'gpa': 3.32},\n    {'term': 'W11', 'gpa': 3.57},\n    {'term': 'S11', 'gpa': 3.71},\n\n    {'term': 'F11', 'gpa': 3.72},\n    {'term': 'W12', 'gpa': 3.92},\n];\n\nvar barWidth = 70;\nvar chartWidth = (barWidth + 10) * gpa_term_data.length;\nvar chartHeight = 200;\nvar padding = 20;\n\n// scales\nvar xScale = d3.scale.linear().\n    domain([0, gpa_term_data.length]).\n    range([0, chartWidth]);\n\nvar yScale = d3.scale.linear().\n    domain([3, d3.max(gpa_term_data, function(datum) {\n        return datum.gpa;\n    })]).\n    range([0, chartHeight]);\n\n// create canvas\nvar chart = d3.select('#chart').\n    append('svg:svg').\n    attr('width', chartWidth).\n    attr('height', chartHeight + padding);\n\n// create rectangle for each datum\nchart.selectAll('rect').\n    data(gpa_term_data).\n    enter().\n    append('svg:rect').\n    attr('x', function(datum, index) {\n        // return x-offset pixels\n        return xScale(index);\n    }).\n    attr('y', function(datum) {\n        // return y-offset pixels, subtract due to origin being in top left\n        return chartHeight - yScale(datum.gpa);\n    }).\n    attr('height', function(datum) {\n        return yScale(datum.gpa);\n    }).\n    attr('width', barWidth).\n    attr('fill', '#2d578b');\n\n// text\nchart.selectAll('text').\n    data(gpa_term_data).\n    enter().\n    append('svg:text').\n    text(function(datum) {\n        return datum.gpa;\n    }).\n    attr('x', function(datum, index) {\n        return xScale(index) + barWidth / 2;\n    }).\n    attr('y', function(datum) {\n        return chartHeight - yScale(datum.gpa);\n    }).\n    attr('dy', '1.2em'). // y padding\n    attr('text-anchor', 'middle').\n    attr('fill', 'white').\n    attr(\"style\", \"font-size: 12; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif\");\n\n// X axis text\nchart.selectAll('text.xAxis').\n    data(gpa_term_data).\n    enter().\n    append('svg:text').\n    attr('class', 'xAxis').\n    text(function(datum) {\n        return datum.term;\n    }).\n    attr('x', function(datum, index) {\n        return xScale(index) + barWidth / 2;\n    }).\n    attr('y', chartHeight + padding).\n    attr('text-anchor', 'middle').\n    attr(\"style\", \"font-size: 12; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif\");\n\n// chart label\nchart.append('svg:text').\n    attr('class', 'label').\n    text('GPA by Term').\n    attr('x', 0).\n    attr('y', 15);\n</script>\n\n<p><br>\nOver the next few days, I’ll be doing more things with d3.js.

For example, TemplateView, the most basic CBV simply displays a\ntemplate which is simple enough to place in the urls.py.\n\n    ::python\n    # urls.py\n    from django.views.generic import TemplateView\n\n    urlpatterns = patterns('',\n        url(r'^$', TemplateView.as_view(template_name='index.html'))\n    )\n\nWhen we point our urls.py towards a view, we invoke the *as_view* function\nto sort of turn the class into a view.

It could be even shorter by omitting the\n*template_name* variable; the CBVs by default look for a template at\n*APPNAME/APPNAME_VIEWNAME* if not template name is given.

It is especially important to practice DRY (don’t repeat\nyourself) in these kinds of codebases. Maintaining code becomes much easier\nby having a generic base code that can be subclassed or extended to fulfill\nspecific needs. Using these concepts can simplify code down to zero-LOC\ntemplates and zero-LOC views.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Django-Class-Based-Generic-Views\"><a href=\"#Django-Class-Based-Generic-Views\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Django Class-Based Generic Views\"></a>Django Class-Based Generic Views</h2><p>Django class-based generic views (CBVs) are like a set of prebuilt views\nthat ships with a lot of commonly used features that can easily be\noveridden. For example, TemplateView, the most basic CBV simply displays a\ntemplate which is simple enough to place in the urls.py.</p>\n<pre><code>::python\n# urls.py\nfrom django.views.generic import TemplateView\n\nurlpatterns = patterns(&apos;&apos;,\n    url(r&apos;^$&apos;, TemplateView.as_view(template_name=&apos;index.html&apos;))\n)\n</code></pre><p>When we point our urls.py towards a view, we invoke the <em>as_view</em> function\nto sort of turn the class into a view. For a CRUD app, there are several\nvery useful generic views.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>django.views.generic.list.ListView</li>\n<li>django.views.generic.detail.DetailView</li>\n<li>django.views.generic.edit.CreateView</li>\n<li>django.views.generic.edit.UpdateView</li>\n<li>django.views.generic.edit.DeleteView</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Implementing-a-Generic-View\"><a href=\"#Implementing-a-Generic-View\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Implementing a Generic View\"></a>Implementing a Generic View</h2><p>Since the generic views have a lot in similar in the way they’re used,\nwe’ll use ListView as an example. Since this is a post about inheritance,\nlet’s create a base ListView that other apps’ ListViews can inherit from.</p>\n<pre><code>::python\n# base/views.py\nfrom django.views.generic import ListView\n\nclass BaseListView(ListView):\n    template_name = &apos;base/base_list.html&apos;\n    paginate_by = 30\n</code></pre><p><strong>And that’s it!</strong> Short, right? It could be even shorter by omitting the\n<em>template_name</em> variable; the CBVs by default look for a template at\n<em>APPNAME/APPNAME_VIEWNAME</em> if not template name is given. So for this\nListView in the base app, it would look at ‘base/base_list.html’, and\nDetailView would look at ‘base/base_detail.html’ and so on.</p>\n<p>In the urls.py, simply import the view and call <em>as_view()</em> on it like with\nthe TemplateView before.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Writing-the-Template\"><a href=\"#Writing-the-Template\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Writing the Template\"></a>Writing the Template</h2><p>For ListView, if paginate_by is defined, Django will paginate the list of\nobjects if necessary. In the template, we can refer to the list of objects\nwith <em>object_list</em> and the pagination object as ‘page_obj’. Ignore the\n<em>my_header</em> for now.</p>\n<pre><code>::jinja\n{% extends \"base.html\" %}\n\n{% block title %}\n        Generic Objects\n    {% endblock %}\n\n&lt;h1&gt;\n    {% block header %}\n            {{ my_header }}\n        {% endblock %}\n&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n{% if page_obj.has_next() %}\n        <a href=\"?page={{ page_obj.next_page_number() }}\" next<=\"\" a=\"\">\n    {% endif %}\n\n{% for obj in object_list %}\n        {{ obj }}\n    {% endfor %}\n</a></code></pre><h2 id=\"Extending-our-BaseListView\"><a href=\"#Extending-our-BaseListView\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Extending our BaseListView\"></a>Extending our BaseListView</h2><p>Take for example an app called <em>books</em> that lets us CRUD books in a\ndatabase.

That was the second earliest time I've woken up thus far\nthis summer. We got to the office for some bagels/cream cheese and orange\njuice. No time to lose, we started hacking.

Check it out!\n\n## Open Web Apps\n\nThe open web is a beautiful mission, and it's difficult to describe. How I\nenvision an open web is a web that is owned by nobody, but innovated by\neverybody. An open web is built upon web standards (HTML 5, CSS3, Javascript)\nand not proprietary locked-down drivel. It's created with common languages that\nevery developer can understand. There are no coporations imposing their\nproprietary 'you are mine' platforms in an attempt to lock in developers into\ntheir markets. If developers are slowed down and locked away, then less cool\nstuff gets to the users, and thus the web would begin to suck.\n\nCurrent app markets (iOS Store, Google Play) kinda suck. They house a lot of\ngreat apps, and they seem alright, but we've gotten complacent.\n\n- Objective-C and Java are the power languages in the app market. It's a cup of\n  tea to some people, but they're clunky by today's standards. Web standard\n  languages are a much lower barrier of entry to development.\n- You need to grab their respective SDKs to develop on them, or even *pay* for\n  them in Apple's case.\n- Developers are locked into either Apple or Google. It's one or the other, you\n  only get to develop for a subset of users. With the web though, it's\n  something most everyone can access. Develop on the web, have it run on\n  everything.\n\nBut wait, weren't Apple's first iPhone apps built on top of the web? Yes, but\nthat was back when Javascript was very slow. The web was not ready then, but\nthe web is ready now. People are starting to get bored of native applications.\nIt's a pretty mundane thing. Open web apps are the future, and it's a bit of a\nself-pat, but Mozilla is paving this road to move the web forward. There is\nonly one mission, make the Internet better for everyone.\n\n## HTML 5 Features\n\nPart of the limelight of the open web is the browser-adoption of HTML 5\nstandards. With it being \"open web app hack day\", we employed several cool HTML\n5 features to Minimalist. A requirement for Minimalist was that it had to work\ncompletely offline. It should be able to add items to a list and have it still\nbe there upon refresh. It should also remember which list it was looking at\nlast. Refreshing the page should not lose state. To do so, we employed\nHTML5's local storage and app cache features.\n\n### Local Storage\n\nIt's like your browser has its own cute little database. Local storage is a\nclient-side key-value store that web apps can access. We can store items into\nlocal storage and pull them back out later without the need for fetching data\nfrom some server on the Internet. It's ridiculously easy to access, with\nJavascript through the **window.localStorage** object. It mostly acts like a\nkey-value store, except it stores everything as a string so remember to\ntype-cast your values correctly. JSON.parse and JSON.stringify really comes in\nhandy here.\n\n### App Cache\n\nConfiguring the app cache tells the client to download everything (usually) and\ncache it. When the client opens the app again, instead of fetching it from your\nserver, it'll just load the pages and elements from its cache. The user can\nvisit the app's URL in the browser offline, and it will still load off its\ncache. To set up the app cache, first create a cache.manifest file in your\napps's root.\n\n    CACHE\n    # v1\n    index.html\n\n    NETWORK\n    jquery.js http://ajax.jquery/jquery.js\n\nThis will tell the browser to cache index.html and to get jquery from the\nInternet if possible. The browser will check for every time the cache manifest\nfile is changed (e.g. bump up v1 to v2), and re-pull resources if necessary.\nNow we don't want to cache the manifest file itself since the browser will be\nstuck with an old version of the app for a while, so we can drop an .htaccess\nfile to specify the correct content type and tell apache not to cache it.\n\n    AddType text/cache-manifest .manifest\n\n    <Files .cache.manifest>\n        ExpiresActive On\n        ExpiresDefault \"access\"\n    </Files>\n\nHm, that should be good. If done correctly, most browsers will display a prompt\nwhether it should store local data from the app.\n\n## What's Next\n\n- It's 5am now, that coffee from noon had its way with me.\n- Standard Marketplace hacking (proud of where it's gotten).\n- Some polishing of DrawNothing and Minimalist.\n- **24h Yahoo Hackathon** next week! Let's go for a third hackathon finish, yeah?\n- Mozilla kayaking day in the bay right afterwards.\n","source":"_posts/023_minimalist.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"Open, HTML 5, Minimalist\"\ntype: blog\ncategory: blog\ndate: 2012-07-08\nid: minimalist\ntags: code\n\nimage:\n    url: http://i.imgur.com/FPcGZ.jpg\n    where: top\n---\n\nAnd the hacking goes on.

The main event for today, Mozilla HTML 5 Webapps\nhackathon. The prize, glory and fame…and smartphones. I teamed up with <a href=\"http://sawyerhollenshead.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Sawyer\nHollenshead</a>, another Mozilla intern, to create\n<a href=\"http://minimalist.ngokevin.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Minimalist</a>, a list-building app for noting\ndown categorized thoughts such as ‘places I want to visit’ or ‘things I want to\naccomplish this year’. Spoilers, we took home smartphones. In this edition of\nthe ngokevin Bi-weekly, I’ll describe how the hack day was, what it means for\nan app to be <strong>open</strong>, and some cool HTML 5 features we used.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Hack-Day\"><a href=\"#Hack-Day\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Hack Day\"></a>Hack Day</h2><p>Got up at early 8am. That was the second earliest time I’ve woken up thus far\nthis summer. We got to the office for some bagels/cream cheese and orange\njuice. No time to lose, we started hacking. We basically split up with him\ntaking mostly the frontend and me the backend. I got off to a quick start, but\nas expected I ran into a pitfall (trying to return from a jQuery .each loop).\nAfter spending half an hour on that, I began to rush myself. I wasn’t really\nthinking about my code, I was kinda just banging on my keyboard.</p>\n<p>Lunch time. Burritos and coffee.</p>\n<p>Now my mind was really mush. I couldn’t make out my rushed code and kept\nhacking on it to make it even more disgusting. It got bad enough that I wasn’t\nmaking too much progress in the last two hours. As time ticked down, I rushed\neven faster, but that didn’t do too much good. Before I knew it, time’s up.\nDamn, wish I had another hour.</p>\n<p>Demo the apps. We rolled the dice on demoing app cache, expecting it to fail,\nwhich it did. Ah, maybe we should’ve rehearsed this. Oh well, presentation went\nfairly well. Other apps featured an IRC bouncer/web client, a\nremake of Bugzilla, and an Instagram clone using shaders and a custom-patched\nFirefox. Up to the judges.</p>\n<p>Minimalist was good for 2nd behind Snappy, an Instagram clone. Ah, if I only I\nhadn’t cracked under the time. Oh well, <strong>constellation prize</strong> (which was also the\ngrand prize), Samsung Galaxy S2s with Firefox OS installed. Later on I went\nhome and regutted out my ugly code and made Minimalist a thing of beauty. After\na long day, I’m proud of the results. See it in the Mozilla Marketplace in the\nfuture. Check it out!</p>\n<h2 id=\"Open-Web-Apps\"><a href=\"#Open-Web-Apps\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Open Web Apps\"></a>Open Web Apps</h2><p>The open web is a beautiful mission, and it’s difficult to describe. How I\nenvision an open web is a web that is owned by nobody, but innovated by\neverybody. An open web is built upon web standards (HTML 5, CSS3, Javascript)\nand not proprietary locked-down drivel. It’s created with common languages that\nevery developer can understand. There are no coporations imposing their\nproprietary ‘you are mine’ platforms in an attempt to lock in developers into\ntheir markets. If developers are slowed down and locked away, then less cool\nstuff gets to the users, and thus the web would begin to suck.</p>\n<p>Current app markets (iOS Store, Google Play) kinda suck. They house a lot of\ngreat apps, and they seem alright, but we’ve gotten complacent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Objective-C and Java are the power languages in the app market. It’s a cup of\ntea to some people, but they’re clunky by today’s standards. Web standard\nlanguages are a much lower barrier of entry to development.</li>\n<li>You need to grab their respective SDKs to develop on them, or even <em>pay</em> for\nthem in Apple’s case.</li>\n<li>Developers are locked into either Apple or Google. It’s one or the other, you\nonly get to develop for a subset of users. With the web though, it’s\nsomething most everyone can access. Develop on the web, have it run on\neverything.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But wait, weren’t Apple’s first iPhone apps built on top of the web? Yes, but\nthat was back when Javascript was very slow. The web was not ready then, but\nthe web is ready now. People are starting to get bored of native applications.\nIt’s a pretty mundane thing. Open web apps are the future, and it’s a bit of a\nself-pat, but Mozilla is paving this road to move the web forward. There is\nonly one mission, make the Internet better for everyone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"HTML-5-Features\"><a href=\"#HTML-5-Features\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"HTML 5 Features\"></a>HTML 5 Features</h2><p>Part of the limelight of the open web is the browser-adoption of HTML 5\nstandards. With it being “open web app hack day”, we employed several cool HTML\n5 features to Minimalist. A requirement for Minimalist was that it had to work\ncompletely offline. It should be able to add items to a list and have it still\nbe there upon refresh. It should also remember which list it was looking at\nlast. Refreshing the page should not lose state. To do so, we employed\nHTML5’s local storage and app cache features.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Local-Storage\"><a href=\"#Local-Storage\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Local Storage\"></a>Local Storage</h3><p>It’s like your browser has its own cute little database. Local storage is a\nclient-side key-value store that web apps can access. We can store items into\nlocal storage and pull them back out later without the need for fetching data\nfrom some server on the Internet. It’s ridiculously easy to access, with\nJavascript through the <strong>window.localStorage</strong> object. It mostly acts like a\nkey-value store, except it stores everything as a string so remember to\ntype-cast your values correctly. JSON.parse and JSON.stringify really comes in\nhandy here.</p>\n<h3 id=\"App-Cache\"><a href=\"#App-Cache\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"App Cache\"></a>App Cache</h3><p>Configuring the app cache tells the client to download everything (usually) and\ncache it. When the client opens the app again, instead of fetching it from your\nserver, it’ll just load the pages and elements from its cache. The user can\nvisit the app’s URL in the browser offline, and it will still load off its\ncache. To set up the app cache, first create a cache.manifest file in your\napps’s root.</p>\n<pre><code>CACHE\n# v1\nindex.html\n\nNETWORK\njquery.js http://ajax.jquery/jquery.js\n</code></pre><p>This will tell the browser to cache index.html and to get jquery from the\nInternet if possible. The browser will check for every time the cache manifest\nfile is changed (e.g. bump up v1 to v2), and re-pull resources if necessary.\nNow we don’t want to cache the manifest file itself since the browser will be\nstuck with an old version of the app for a while, so we can drop an .htaccess\nfile to specify the correct content type and tell apache not to cache it.</p>\n<pre><code>AddType text/cache-manifest .manifest\n\n&lt;Files .cache.manifest&gt;\n    ExpiresActive On\n    ExpiresDefault &quot;access&quot;\n&lt;/Files&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Hm, that should be good.

The goal was to create a side-scrolling platform game\nwhere players could create their levels, and the idea was inspired by the video\ngames, LittleBigPlanet (a side-scrolling platformer where players create and\nshare levels) and Garry's Mod (a physics sandbox game). I wanted to learn what\nit was somewhat like to create a game, even though I relied upon a Javascript\nlibrary to do a lot of the thinking for me. Since it's a web application and\ntherefore cross-platform, people could create levels on the desktop and play\nthem on mobile. Though I haven't gotten quite that far.\n\n###The Features\n\nAfter hacking for 24 hours solo, I got Grandbox to a presentable state that I\nwas quite proud of. It currently has a sandbox mode where you control little\npink ball that can roll around and jump. On the sidebar, there are objects that\nyou can add to the world that interact with the player and other objects. I\nimplemented a handful of objects such as balls, boxes, platforms, springboards,\nand landmines. You can jump on these objects, push them around, or stack them\nup. There's the option of setting different attributes of these objects such as\ntheir size or bounciness. I was also able to work in a history widget where\nobjects that were added can be viewed, deleted, or even binded. Binding objects\ntogether is somewhat like welding objects together, which can allow for some\npretty cool stuff.\n\n###Demoing\n\nI demo'ed Grandbox several times that week, once for Yahoo! and a couple times\nfor Mozilla. Each time, I tried to make a 'rocketship' that would launch our\nlittle ball off-screen. I would create a little box around my ball, binding\nthem together. On the inside, I inserted an extremely bouncy springboard on the\nground. Then I dropped a ton of 'land mines' inside the rocketship, which\napplies impulse to objects it contact. So the land mines would bounce off of\nthe springboard and hit the top of the inside of the rocketship, propelling it\nupwards to infinity and beyond. I only got that demo to work the first time.\n\n###What's Next\n\nClean up some collision bugs, write a JSON-serializer that\nserializes the object history into a string and saves the world, write a\nJSON-parser that parses that object history and loads the world, add more\ncomponents, and write my own Canvas renderer rather than using Box2DWeb's debug\nrenderer. Though I kinda doubt I'll have time to do any of that.\n\nBuilding this in less than a day, I think this is a good testament as to how\neasy and accessible it is to build for the web.

I only got that demo to work the first time.</p>\n<p>###What’s Next</p>\n<p>Clean up some collision bugs, write a JSON-serializer that\nserializes the object history into a string and saves the world, write a\nJSON-parser that parses that object history and loads the world, add more\ncomponents, and write my own Canvas renderer rather than using Box2DWeb’s debug\nrenderer. Though I kinda doubt I’ll have time to do any of that.</p>\n<p>Building this in less than a day, I think this is a good testament as to how\neasy and accessible it is to build for the web.

The slides were intended to skim the\niceberg of a professional poker player's mindset. Though I'll skim over what I\ntalked about here.\n\n### My Poker Career in a Nutshell\n\nI first started playing online poker seriously on Pokerstars sometime during my\nfreshman year of college. Attracted by those endless promotions poker rooms\nhave, my first deposit into Pokerstars was $20. I read books, dove into forums,\ndid the math, paid for coaching videos, studied the game as if it were for my\ncomputer science degree.\n\nI began to beat the microstakes (2NL 6max) at a hot rate of 20 big blinds per\n100 hands over several tens of thousands of hands. I played 4 tables at a time,\nand played at least 4 hours a day.  I moved onto 5NL on Full Tilt where I kept\nbeating the game, then went through a long downswing, though still up. I tried\nmy hand at a bit of heads-up; it wasn't my thing.  The US Department of Justice\neventually seized Poker Stars and Full Tilt on what was deemed \"Black Friday\".\nThat was the end of that.\n\n### The Fundamental Theorem of Poker\n\nWe'll jump right into Sklansky's famous fundamental theorem of poker.\n\n*\"Every time you play a hand differently from the way you would have played it\nif you could see all your opponents' cards, they gain; and every time you play\nyour hand the same way you would have played it if you could see all their\ncards, they lose. Conversely, every time opponents play their hands differently\nfrom the way they would have if they could see all your cards, you gain; and\nevery time they play their hands the same way they would have played if they\ncould see all your cards, you lose.\"* - David Sklansky\n\nThat makes sense. If we could see all of our opponent's cards, we would play\nperfectly and win. We can derive a mathematical expression for this by saying\nthat the more we deviate from playing as if we could see all of the cards, the\nless benefit we gain. We can represent this most simply as **Expected Value**.\n\n### Expected Value\n\nExpected value (EV) is basically **how much you gain or lose on average on a\ndecision in the long run.** Say we flip a coin where I get $1 if it's Heads and\nyou get $2 if it's Tails. My EV is -$.50 and your's would be +$.50. Sure it's\npossible for me to get lucky and get a few tosses in my favor, but in the long\nrun it's a good deal for you as you stand to gain positive EV, average $.50 per\nflip.\n\nNow let's translate this into poker. Say we both go all-in with me holding\n27-offsuit and you holding AA. It's possible for me to get lucky and win the\nhand, but it doesn't mean you made the wrong decision. I have an 11% chance of\nwinning and my EV is -$1.22. It would clearly be a profitable\nscenario for you, regardless of the outcome.\n\nMaking +EV decisions over a long enough period means a gain. This is the\nfundamental idea of winning poker in the long run. Not mind-reading, not\npsychology, not picking up tells.\n\n### Somewhat Advanced Math and Probability Stuff\n\nWith this established, I go into some concepts based on EV. I made these hands\nup to best represent the concepts and present tougher decisions. Hey, I even\nspent a long time doing the math, crunching numbers. These concepts include\n**pot odds, effective pot odds, implied odds, reverse implied odds, semibluffs,\nand fold equity**. Most often, one can apply pot odds to see whether they stand\nto gain on calling a bet or raise, though they can apply to all decisions.\n\nI won't go into them on detail, but the main idea of all of these concepts is\nto **present situations where one could actually calculate the EV of their\npossible actions** to make an informed poker decision in practice.\n\nI highly recommend taking a gander over these slides as they explain themselves\npretty well.\n\n### Hold'em Strategy\n\nAfter I got some theory out of the went, I explained very basic hold'em\nstrategy. I went through what it means to play solid tight-aggressive (TAG)\npoker including hand selection, positional awareness, general postflop play\ntips. Then I went through some hand reading examples.\n\n### Different Playing Styles\n\nWhen playing at a table, it's important to identify the types of players at the\ntable as well as playing a solid playing style yourself. A good way to\ncategorize players online with the help of a poker heads-up-display (HUD) is by\ntheir stats. Three stats that make it really easy to determine a player's style\nare **Voluntary Put-in Pot % (VPIP), Preflop Raise % (PFR), and 3-bet % (3B)**.\nVPIP is the percentage of hands they choose to play, PFR is the percentage of\nhands they raise preflop (rather than simply call and limp), and 3B is the\npercentage of hands they reraise.\n\nA weak-tight player tends to have a very low VPIP, and a non-existent PFR. They\nplay very few hands (less than 10%), are not very aggressive, and fold\neasily.\n\nA loose-passive player has a high VPIP (more than 28%), and also a small PFR.\nThey play a lot of hands and aren't very aggressive with them.  Rather than bet\nand raise, they will call with marginal hands or even nothing.\n\nA tight-aggressive player has a low, but focused VPIP (13-18%) and a large PFR\n(usually around the same as their VPIP). They choose +EV hands to play and play\nthem aggressively. They don't limp preflop and usually always open the pot with\na raise. This is an extremely solid style of poker and most poker players that\nplay for living employ either this style or loose-aggressive.\n\nA loose-aggressive player is pretty much the same as a tight-aggressive player,\nbut plays a bit more hands (20-26%).\n\n### Positional Awareness\n\n**Position is power**. No, seriously. You have more EV playing hands in-position\nthan out-of-position. Good position is being in the seat that acts later in the\nhand. The best positions are the button and cut-off (person in front of the\nbutter), and the worst positions are the small blind, big blind, and\nunder-the-gun (first to act preflop). Why you get more EV playing in-position\nis because **you know what your opponents choose to do before you have to\nact**. You thus have more information than your opponents in the hand. With\npoker being a game of incomplete information, information is key.\n\nFor this reason, you should be extremely tight out-of-position, but you can\nloosen up your hand selection in-position. I included a rough hand\nselection chart weighted by position in the slides.\n\n### Cards in the Air\n\nI go on to talk about post-flop play, [poker\nmindset](http://ngokevin.com/~ngoke/pokerprez/#/mindset) (which I also\nrecommend skimming), and tools and resources. Really, I could write forever and\never about the intracacies of poker and really hope the poker legislation in\nthe US loosens up in the future. It's really a different game than what Casino\nRoyale 007 and what ESPN portrays. Having been a long spectator of these three\ngames, **I can honestly say poker is a game similar to that of chess and\nStarcraft. And like all other games, it's more fun when you're winning.** So\nperhaps at your next poker party, the words of David Sklansky will reverberate\nin your head as you ponder that tough river call.\n","source":"_posts/026_pokerprez.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"The Theory of Poker and Hold'em Strategy\"\ntype: blog\ncategory: blog\ndate: 2012-10-15\nid: poker\ntags: poker\n\nimage:\n    url: http://imgur.com/fzeMH.jpg\n    where: top\n---\n\nAt [Beaver Bar Camp X](http://lug.oregonstate.edu/blog/bbcx), I gave a talk on\nthe theory of poker and hold'em strategy.

The slides were intended to skim the\niceberg of a professional poker player’s mindset. Though I’ll skim over what I\ntalked about here.</p>\n<h3 id=\"My-Poker-Career-in-a-Nutshell\"><a href=\"#My-Poker-Career-in-a-Nutshell\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"My Poker Career in a Nutshell\"></a>My Poker Career in a Nutshell</h3><p>I first started playing online poker seriously on Pokerstars sometime during my\nfreshman year of college. Attracted by those endless promotions poker rooms\nhave, my first deposit into Pokerstars was $20. I read books, dove into forums,\ndid the math, paid for coaching videos, studied the game as if it were for my\ncomputer science degree.</p>\n<p>I began to beat the microstakes (2NL 6max) at a hot rate of 20 big blinds per\n100 hands over several tens of thousands of hands. I played 4 tables at a time,\nand played at least 4 hours a day.  I moved onto 5NL on Full Tilt where I kept\nbeating the game, then went through a long downswing, though still up. I tried\nmy hand at a bit of heads-up; it wasn’t my thing.  The US Department of Justice\neventually seized Poker Stars and Full Tilt on what was deemed “Black Friday”.\nThat was the end of that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"The-Fundamental-Theorem-of-Poker\"><a href=\"#The-Fundamental-Theorem-of-Poker\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Fundamental Theorem of Poker\"></a>The Fundamental Theorem of Poker</h3><p>We’ll jump right into Sklansky’s famous fundamental theorem of poker.</p>\n<p><em>“Every time you play a hand differently from the way you would have played it\nif you could see all your opponents’ cards, they gain; and every time you play\nyour hand the same way you would have played it if you could see all their\ncards, they lose. Conversely, every time opponents play their hands differently\nfrom the way they would have if they could see all your cards, you gain; and\nevery time they play their hands the same way they would have played if they\ncould see all your cards, you lose.”</em> - David Sklansky</p>\n<p>That makes sense. If we could see all of our opponent’s cards, we would play\nperfectly and win. We can derive a mathematical expression for this by saying\nthat the more we deviate from playing as if we could see all of the cards, the\nless benefit we gain. We can represent this most simply as <strong>Expected Value</strong>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Expected-Value\"><a href=\"#Expected-Value\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Expected Value\"></a>Expected Value</h3><p>Expected value (EV) is basically <strong>how much you gain or lose on average on a\ndecision in the long run.</strong> Say we flip a coin where I get $1 if it’s Heads and\nyou get $2 if it’s Tails. My EV is -$.50 and your’s would be +$.50. Sure it’s\npossible for me to get lucky and get a few tosses in my favor, but in the long\nrun it’s a good deal for you as you stand to gain positive EV, average $.50 per\nflip.</p>\n<p>Now let’s translate this into poker. Say we both go all-in with me holding\n27-offsuit and you holding AA. It’s possible for me to get lucky and win the\nhand, but it doesn’t mean you made the wrong decision. I have an 11% chance of\nwinning and my EV is -$1.22. It would clearly be a profitable\nscenario for you, regardless of the outcome.</p>\n<p>Making +EV decisions over a long enough period means a gain. This is the\nfundamental idea of winning poker in the long run. Not mind-reading, not\npsychology, not picking up tells.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Somewhat-Advanced-Math-and-Probability-Stuff\"><a href=\"#Somewhat-Advanced-Math-and-Probability-Stuff\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Somewhat Advanced Math and Probability Stuff\"></a>Somewhat Advanced Math and Probability Stuff</h3><p>With this established, I go into some concepts based on EV. I made these hands\nup to best represent the concepts and present tougher decisions. Hey, I even\nspent a long time doing the math, crunching numbers. These concepts include\n<strong>pot odds, effective pot odds, implied odds, reverse implied odds, semibluffs,\nand fold equity</strong>. Most often, one can apply pot odds to see whether they stand\nto gain on calling a bet or raise, though they can apply to all decisions.</p>\n<p>I won’t go into them on detail, but the main idea of all of these concepts is\nto <strong>present situations where one could actually calculate the EV of their\npossible actions</strong> to make an informed poker decision in practice.</p>\n<p>I highly recommend taking a gander over these slides as they explain themselves\npretty well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Hold’em-Strategy\"><a href=\"#Hold’em-Strategy\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Hold’em Strategy\"></a>Hold’em Strategy</h3><p>After I got some theory out of the went, I explained very basic hold’em\nstrategy. I went through what it means to play solid tight-aggressive (TAG)\npoker including hand selection, positional awareness, general postflop play\ntips. Then I went through some hand reading examples.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Different-Playing-Styles\"><a href=\"#Different-Playing-Styles\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Different Playing Styles\"></a>Different Playing Styles</h3><p>When playing at a table, it’s important to identify the types of players at the\ntable as well as playing a solid playing style yourself. A good way to\ncategorize players online with the help of a poker heads-up-display (HUD) is by\ntheir stats. Three stats that make it really easy to determine a player’s style\nare <strong>Voluntary Put-in Pot % (VPIP), Preflop Raise % (PFR), and 3-bet % (3B)</strong>.\nVPIP is the percentage of hands they choose to play, PFR is the percentage of\nhands they raise preflop (rather than simply call and limp), and 3B is the\npercentage of hands they reraise.</p>\n<p>A weak-tight player tends to have a very low VPIP, and a non-existent PFR. They\nplay very few hands (less than 10%), are not very aggressive, and fold\neasily.</p>\n<p>A loose-passive player has a high VPIP (more than 28%), and also a small PFR.\nThey play a lot of hands and aren’t very aggressive with them.  Rather than bet\nand raise, they will call with marginal hands or even nothing.</p>\n<p>A tight-aggressive player has a low, but focused VPIP (13-18%) and a large PFR\n(usually around the same as their VPIP). They choose +EV hands to play and play\nthem aggressively. They don’t limp preflop and usually always open the pot with\na raise. This is an extremely solid style of poker and most poker players that\nplay for living employ either this style or loose-aggressive.</p>\n<p>A loose-aggressive player is pretty much the same as a tight-aggressive player,\nbut plays a bit more hands (20-26%).</p>\n<h3 id=\"Positional-Awareness\"><a href=\"#Positional-Awareness\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Positional Awareness\"></a>Positional Awareness</h3><p><strong>Position is power</strong>. No, seriously. You have more EV playing hands in-position\nthan out-of-position. Good position is being in the seat that acts later in the\nhand. The best positions are the button and cut-off (person in front of the\nbutter), and the worst positions are the small blind, big blind, and\nunder-the-gun (first to act preflop). Why you get more EV playing in-position\nis because <strong>you know what your opponents choose to do before you have to\nact</strong>. You thus have more information than your opponents in the hand. With\npoker being a game of incomplete information, information is key.</p>\n<p>For this reason, you should be extremely tight out-of-position, but you can\nloosen up your hand selection in-position. I included a rough hand\nselection chart weighted by position in the slides.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Cards-in-the-Air\"><a href=\"#Cards-in-the-Air\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Cards in the Air\"></a>Cards in the Air</h3><p>I go on to talk about post-flop play, <a href=\"http://ngokevin.com/~ngoke/pokerprez/#/mindset\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">poker\nmindset</a> (which I also\nrecommend skimming), and tools and resources. Really, I could write forever and\never about the intracacies of poker and really hope the poker legislation in\nthe US loosens up in the future. It’s really a different game than what Casino\nRoyale 007 and what ESPN portrays. Having been a long spectator of these three\ngames, <strong>I can honestly say poker is a game similar to that of chess and\nStarcraft. And like all other games, it’s more fun when you’re winning.</strong> So\nperhaps at your next poker party, the words of David Sklansky will reverberate\nin your head as you ponder that tough river call.</p>\n"},{"title":"Sublime Text is a Bodybagger","type":"blog","date":"2013-02-03T08:00:00.000Z","id":"sublime","image":{"url":"http://i.imgur.com/VVAdK0t.jpg","where":"top"},"_content":"\nCall me a mouse-atheist.

But then I went into my programming <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/405shFa.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Avatar\nState</a>, bending my arsenal of media queries at\nwill.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In my Web Developer State, I yielded RWD. <strong>My RWD process</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Take a desktop site that looks like complete bollocks when not 1920x1080.</li>\n<li>Using the browser’s RWD tools, slowly shrink my browser until everything\ngoes to aforementioned bollocks.</li>\n<li>Set a breakpoint with the current width of the page as a media query.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Start off with a shiny new media query with the max-width set to our measured\nbreakpoint. Note a couple things. We do not use common device widths as our\nmedia query breakpoints; we observe and let the design dictate where our mobile\ncss is needed. And we do not use px’s in our media queries, rather we convert\nand use em’s since they are smart enough to handle browser zooming.</p>\n<p>First things first. Make sure to have a meta tag telling mobile browsers to\nnot lie about their width as do people lie about their age. Otherwise, our\nmedia queries will be sorrowfully rejected.</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width&quot;&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Now we start slapping on some width-wary CSS.</p>\n<pre><code>::scss\n@media all and (max-width: 61.25em) {\n    /* CSS when the window width &lt; 980px. */\n    #wrap {\n        width: 90%;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>Following my process earlier, I noticed I had a fixed width page at 940px. When\nshrinking the browser below that, the content did not reflow. Thus when past\nthat 940px point, I tell my container to shrink as the screen shrinks.</p>\n<p>After applying some more fixes until satisfaction, I <strong>iterate and repeat my\nRWD process</strong>. I shrink my browser some more until the content starts\nimploding. The breakpoint this time was 768px, or for my blog, 48em. Time for\nanother media query.</p>\n<pre><code>::scss\n@media all and (max-width: 48em) {\n    #header {\n        margin-bottom: 78px;\n        .logos {\n            position: static;\n            text-align: center;\n        }\n        #navigation {\n            position: static;\n            padding-top: 26px;\n            text-align: center;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>The navigation was now having a spat with my blog header. Here is another\nsnippet that de-inlines my header elements and puts my navigation block on\nanother line. The actual CSS does not really matter here, but I am outlining\nthe iterative process of finding the doom spot, making an encapsulated media\nquery, and then fixing it.</p>\n<p>The fun part about working with responsive web design is that <strong>we do not have\nto worry about breaking anything!</strong> It was already initially unusable like fork\nin soup, and applying CSS that is enclosed within media queries does not affect\nthe desktop version. We are free to hack away without worries. Until we reach\nour desired effect, it is just us and the CSS.</p>\n"},{"title":"Web Design Heuristics","type":"blog","date":"2012-11-13T08:00:00.000Z","id":"webdesignhacks","image":{"url":"http://i.imgur.com/MIVvm.jpg","where":"right"},"_content":"\nLast weekend, I built a site for a new club on campus as my first freelance gig\n(though I also handled the domain name and hosting). For the past couple\nmonths, I have been a little interested in visual design and user\nexperience. This design exhibits some tricks I picked up and often use make\nthings look pretty. I dub this plastic surgery, as it is a quick and simple\npath to beautification.\n\n---\n\n## Typography\n\nThe easiest way to give your website an entire makeover, change the fonts. The most popular resource is [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts). They have a wide selection and you can sort by popularity as well as\nserif/sans-serif. Try out different fonts and see the changes in character\nthey make for your site and try to choose a font that matches your site's\npurpose.\n\nA good rule of thumb is to choose two fonts, one serif and one sans-serif.\nUse the serif for your headers as it looks more elegant and use sans-serif\nfor your content as it is more readable.\n\nCurrently, even this magnificent blog needs a bit of work on the typography\n(font-sizing). Typography takes a lot of toying with!\n\n- [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts)\n- A serif font for headers, a sans-serif font for content\n- Use a good-sized line height (space between lines of text) for readability\n- Have contrast between text and background\n\n## Building a Color Palette\n\nThe color palette defines the \"mood\" of the site. However, it is more important\nthat your selected colors don't clash. Just like in music, dissonance is not\npleasant to the senses. You can use\n[colorschemedesigner](http://colorschemedesigner.com) to get ideas on what\ncolors work well together and simply browse for colors.\n\nIn the example above, I simply opt to use browned-orange as a primary color to\nmatch the header logo and with rare bits of turquoise blue as a complement.\nSince the site is dark-themed, I only used a two-color palette since\ndark-themed designs already have depth and busy-ness.\n\nLastly, don't use pure black and pure white without good reason. Black and\nwhite stand out very strongly and obnoxiously demand attention. Instead use\noff-blacks and off-whites. You can even add some saturation to give your black\nand white colors the most slightest hint of color.\n\nIf using a CSS preprocessor, pre-define your colors as global constants and\nalways use those constants in your CSS color rules (e.g. color: $blue). And as\nmentioned earlier, also define your off-blacks and off-whites as constants\n(e.g. $black: rgb(10, 10, 10), $white: rgb(245, 245, 245))\n\n- [colorschemedesigner](http://colorschemedesigner.com)\n- Keep a simple palette.\n- Use off-blacks and off-whites over pure black and pure white.\n- Saturate your blacks and whites for subtle color.\n\n## Textures\n\nUsing texture patterns in your site gives it nice and subtle detail. A\ntexture pattern over a plain color background really adds some polish and\nmakes a difference. [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com), like\nGoogle Web Fonts, is a free collection...but this time for texture patterns\nto use as backgrounds.\n\nJust don't go overboard and use ten different textures. It's the modern era\nof minimalism.

[Font\nAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/) is a growing\ncollection of free icon fonts. These are especially useful on front pages\nwhere you have headers describing your next cool social network you are\nbuilding.\n\nThere are many of them, and they can be used in whatever size or color your\nspecify in the CSS.

It is technical in that I analyze\nlighting conditions and control for the desired exposure (aperture, shutter\nspeed, ISO, flash power...the standard sphiel) that captures all the detail I\nneed for post-processing,\n\n**Editing** is picking the keepers from the lemons, a whole 'nutha process by\nitself. Processing, to me, is bringing out the details, exposure, and colors\nwanted from an image. It is technical in that I become familiar with a bunch of\nsliders and histograms that alter the image. It is creative in the sense that I\nselect which images to keep to create a coherent set and that I process the\nimage to highlight what I want emphasized.\n\n**Sharing** is social (yeah, really). The final results are taken and set free\nonline. Really, I don't care too much if no one bothers to look at them, but\nit is satisfaction enough to have them out there. I can sometimes show the\nresults in person and have it to support a conversation. There is a technical\npart for this as I hand-built the [image gallery on my site](/gallery). It is\nmy [Javascript baby](http://github.com/ngokevin/sriracha) that has grown over\nthe years which now conveniently feeds off of imgur and flickr APIs.\nPhotography will allow me to discover domain-specific problems to solve as side\nprojects that will become useful to other photographers.\n\nAbove all, the satisfying feeling is pulling the shutter, taking a glance at\nthe camera's LCD, and knowing I captured a winner.

It had served as the app's poker\nbet slider. All I wanted was a simple slider widget from jQuery Mobile, but the\nUI framework wanted me to marry it in return. It had its way with my HTML\nmarkup, littering my DOM elements with selfish classes and attributes, like\nan open garbage truck on the freeway. My CSS rules felt oppressed like liberal\ncollege students as jQuery Mobile's CSS files applied forceful rules my\ntop-level ```html``` and ```body``` elements. The kicker? The slider quickly\nbecame deprecated, not working on newer versions of Firefox.  Never even saw it\nwork on Chrome.\n\n---\n\n## AngularJS Directives\n\nMy disappointment digresses. The point is: I assembled my own customizable\nmobile slider that hooked into AngularJS in the form of a directive. Let us\nbegin with the HTML, which AngularJS enhances with declarative two-way bindings.\n\n    ::html\n    <div slider class=\"slider\" min=\"0\" max=\"9001\" step=\"10\">\n      <span></span>\n    </div>\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the most exciting display of AngularJS's abilities.\nThough by giving the element my ```slider``` attribute, I make the element a\ntemplate for our AngularJS directive named ```slider```, which is where all the\nmagic will happen. There are other ways to syntactically bind the directive to\nthe element through the ```restrict``` parameter, we even make it look like a\n```<slider>``` tag. Note that the following Javascript code snippets are parts\nof a whole.\n\n    ::js\n    var myApp = angular.module('my-app',['my-app.directives']);\n\n    var directives = angular.module('my-app.directives', []);\n    directives.directive('slider', function() {\n        return {\n            link: function(scope, element, attrs) {\n                // Linking function.\n                // {{ initialize }}\n                // {{ event handler }}\n                // {{ scope updater }}\n                // {{ scope watcher }}\n            }\n        };\n    });\n\nDirectives teach HTML new tricks, allowing us to write reusable components and\nwidgets. The link function allows us to register event handlers and watches on\nthe scope, all binded to our template. ```link``` supplies the AngularJS scope,\nthe element acting as the directive template, and attributes of the element.\n\n##Initialize\n\nLet us get some initialization out of the way.\n\n    ::js\n    // Linking function.\n    var $element = $(element);\n    var $bar = $('span', $element);\n    var step = attrs.step;\n\n    var width;\n    var offset;\n\n    var mouseDown = false;\n    element.on('mousedown touchstart', function(evt) {\n        mouseDown = true;\n        if (!width) {\n            width = $element.width();\n        } if (!offset) {\n            offset = $bar.offset().left;\n        }\n    });\n\n    element.on('mouseup touchend', function(evt) {\n        mouseDown = false;\n    });\n\nThis just allows us to determine whether the user is currently dragging the\nslider with a click or touch.\n\n##Event Handler\n\nWhenever the user drags the slider, we want to update its binded scope value.\nVice-versa, whenever the binded scope value changes, we want to visually\nupdate the slider's fill.\n\n    ::js\n    // Throttle function to 1 call per 25ms for performance.\n    element.on('mousemove touchmove', _.throttle(function(evt) {\n        if (!mouseDown) {\n            // Don't drag the slider on mousemove hover, only on click-n-drag.\n            return;\n        }\n\n        // Calculate distance of the cursor/finger from beginning of slider\n        var diff;\n        if (evt.pageX) {\n            diff = evt.pageX - offset;\n        } else {\n            diff = evt.originalEvent.touches[0].pageX - offset;\n        }\n\nAbove is the math driving the slider. We want to calculate how far the slider\nis dragged relative to the max value of the slider, in terms of a percentage.\n\n##Scope Updater\n\nWe then take that percentage of the max value to attain the slider's value.\nThat value is then applied to the scope.\n\n    ::js\n        // Allow dragging past the limits of the slider, but impose min/max values.\n        if (diff < 0) {\n            scope.sliderValue = attrs.min;\n            $bar.width('0%');\n        } else if (diff > width) {\n            scope.sliderValue = attrs.max;\n            $bar.width('100%');\n\n        // Set the value to percentage of slider filled against a max value.\n        } else {\n            var percent = diff / width;\n            $bar.width(percent * 100 + '%');\n            scope.sliderValue = Math.round(percent * attrs.max / step) * step);\n        }\n\n        // Let all the watchers know we have updated the slider value.\n        scope.$apply();\n    }, 25));\n\nWe have enough to calculate the slider's value. We set the width of the inner\nspan to create the visual effect of the slider, and update the scope's slider\nvalue.\n\n##Scope Watcher\n\nThis accomplishes one-way data binding; if we change the slider, we\nchange the slider's value in the scope. But we also need to account for if the\nslider's value in the scope is changed somewhere else, we need to visually\nupdate the slider. We accomplish this by registering a watcher on the scope.\n\n    ::js\n    scope.$watch('sliderValue', function(sliderValue) {\n        $bar.width(sliderValue / attrs.max * 100 + '%');\n    });\n\nWhen the slider's value in the scope is updated somewhere else, the watcher\nwill trigger our callback function. We change the slider's fill percentage to\nrespectively match the new slider value.\n\n##CSS\n\nSetting the width of the inner span changes the fill of the slider.\n\n    ::scss\n    .slider {\n        @include box-shadow(inset 0 -1px 1px rgba(255,255,255,0.3));\n        background: rgb(10, 10, 10)\n        border-radius: 5px;\n        height: 20px;\n        padding: 10px;\n        position: relative;\n        > span {\n            @include gradient(rgb(43,194,83) 37%, rgb(84,240,84) 69%);\n            @include box-shadow(\n                inset 0 2px 9px  rgba(255,255,255,0.3)\\,\n                inset 0 -2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.4)\n            );\n            background-color: rgb(43,194,83);\n            border-radius: 20px 8px 8px 20px;\n            font-weight: bold;\n            display: block;\n            height: 100%;\n            overflow: hidden;\n            position: relative;\n        }\n    }\n\nTo view the code, inspect the code for this page as I inlined it in the HTML.\n\n## Up Next\n\nBy now you might have started on your own sweet AngularJS app. But testing is\nan important part of development.

It had served as the app's poker\nbet slider. All I wanted was a simple slider widget from jQuery Mobile, but the\nUI framework wanted me to marry it in return. It had its way with my HTML\nmarkup, littering my DOM elements with selfish classes and attributes, like\nan open garbage truck on the freeway. My CSS rules felt oppressed like liberal\ncollege students as jQuery Mobile's CSS files applied forceful rules my\ntop-level ```html``` and ```body``` elements. The kicker? The slider quickly\nbecame deprecated, not working on newer versions of Firefox.  Never even saw it\nwork on Chrome.\n\n---\n\n## AngularJS Directives\n\nMy disappointment digresses. The point is: I assembled my own customizable\nmobile slider that hooked into AngularJS in the form of a directive. Let us\nbegin with the HTML, which AngularJS enhances with declarative two-way bindings.\n\n    ::html\n    <div slider class=\"slider\" min=\"0\" max=\"9001\" step=\"10\">\n      <span></span>\n    </div>\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the most exciting display of AngularJS's abilities.\nThough by giving the element my ```slider``` attribute, I make the element a\ntemplate for our AngularJS directive named ```slider```, which is where all the\nmagic will happen. There are other ways to syntactically bind the directive to\nthe element through the ```restrict``` parameter, we even make it look like a\n```<slider>``` tag. Note that the following Javascript code snippets are parts\nof a whole.\n\n    ::js\n    var myApp = angular.module('my-app',['my-app.directives']);\n\n    var directives = angular.module('my-app.directives', []);\n    directives.directive('slider', function() {\n        return {\n            link: function(scope, element, attrs) {\n                // Linking function.\n                // {{ initialize }}\n                // {{ event handler }}\n                // {{ scope updater }}\n                // {{ scope watcher }}\n            }\n        };\n    });\n\nDirectives teach HTML new tricks, allowing us to write reusable components and\nwidgets. The link function allows us to register event handlers and watches on\nthe scope, all binded to our template. ```link``` supplies the AngularJS scope,\nthe element acting as the directive template, and attributes of the element.\n\n##Initialize\n\nLet us get some initialization out of the way.\n\n    ::js\n    // Linking function.\n    var $element = $(element);\n    var $bar = $('span', $element);\n    var step = attrs.step;\n\n    var width;\n    var offset;\n\n    var mouseDown = false;\n    element.on('mousedown touchstart', function(evt) {\n        mouseDown = true;\n        if (!width) {\n            width = $element.width();\n        } if (!offset) {\n            offset = $bar.offset().left;\n        }\n    });\n\n    element.on('mouseup touchend', function(evt) {\n        mouseDown = false;\n    });\n\nThis just allows us to determine whether the user is currently dragging the\nslider with a click or touch.\n\n##Event Handler\n\nWhenever the user drags the slider, we want to update its binded scope value.\nVice-versa, whenever the binded scope value changes, we want to visually\nupdate the slider's fill.\n\n    ::js\n    // Throttle function to 1 call per 25ms for performance.\n    element.on('mousemove touchmove', _.throttle(function(evt) {\n        if (!mouseDown) {\n            // Don't drag the slider on mousemove hover, only on click-n-drag.\n            return;\n        }\n\n        // Calculate distance of the cursor/finger from beginning of slider\n        var diff;\n        if (evt.pageX) {\n            diff = evt.pageX - offset;\n        } else {\n            diff = evt.originalEvent.touches[0].pageX - offset;\n        }\n\nAbove is the math driving the slider. We want to calculate how far the slider\nis dragged relative to the max value of the slider, in terms of a percentage.\n\n##Scope Updater\n\nWe then take that percentage of the max value to attain the slider's value.\nThat value is then applied to the scope.\n\n    ::js\n        // Allow dragging past the limits of the slider, but impose min/max values.\n        if (diff < 0) {\n            scope.sliderValue = attrs.min;\n            $bar.width('0%');\n        } else if (diff > width) {\n            scope.sliderValue = attrs.max;\n            $bar.width('100%');\n\n        // Set the value to percentage of slider filled against a max value.\n        } else {\n            var percent = diff / width;\n            $bar.width(percent * 100 + '%');\n            scope.sliderValue = Math.round(percent * attrs.max / step) * step);\n        }\n\n        // Let all the watchers know we have updated the slider value.\n        scope.$apply();\n    }, 25));\n\nWe have enough to calculate the slider's value. We set the width of the inner\nspan to create the visual effect of the slider, and update the scope's slider\nvalue.\n\n##Scope Watcher\n\nThis accomplishes one-way data binding; if we change the slider, we\nchange the slider's value in the scope. But we also need to account for if the\nslider's value in the scope is changed somewhere else, we need to visually\nupdate the slider. We accomplish this by registering a watcher on the scope.\n\n    ::js\n    scope.$watch('sliderValue', function(sliderValue) {\n        $bar.width(sliderValue / attrs.max * 100 + '%');\n    });\n\nWhen the slider's value in the scope is updated somewhere else, the watcher\nwill trigger our callback function. We change the slider's fill percentage to\nrespectively match the new slider value.\n\n##CSS\n\nSetting the width of the inner span changes the fill of the slider.\n\n    ::scss\n    .slider {\n        @include box-shadow(inset 0 -1px 1px rgba(255,255,255,0.3));\n        background: rgb(10, 10, 10)\n        border-radius: 5px;\n        height: 20px;\n        padding: 10px;\n        position: relative;\n        > span {\n            @include gradient(rgb(43,194,83) 37%, rgb(84,240,84) 69%);\n            @include box-shadow(\n                inset 0 2px 9px  rgba(255,255,255,0.3)\\,\n                inset 0 -2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.4)\n            );\n            background-color: rgb(43,194,83);\n            border-radius: 20px 8px 8px 20px;\n            font-weight: bold;\n            display: block;\n            height: 100%;\n            overflow: hidden;\n            position: relative;\n        }\n    }\n\nTo view the code, inspect the code for this page as I inlined it in the HTML.\n\n## Up Next\n\nBy now you might have started on your own sweet AngularJS app. But testing is\nan important part of development.

The point is: I assembled my own customizable\nmobile slider that hooked into AngularJS in the form of a directive. Let us\nbegin with the HTML, which AngularJS enhances with declarative two-way bindings.</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;div slider class=&quot;slider&quot; min=&quot;0&quot; max=&quot;9001&quot; step=&quot;10&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Unfortunately, this is not the most exciting display of AngularJS’s abilities.\nThough by giving the element my <code>slider</code> attribute, I make the element a\ntemplate for our AngularJS directive named <code>slider</code>, which is where all the\nmagic will happen. There are other ways to syntactically bind the directive to\nthe element through the <code>restrict</code> parameter, we even make it look like a\n<code>&lt;slider&gt;</code> tag. Note that the following Javascript code snippets are parts\nof a whole.</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nvar myApp = angular.module(&apos;my-app&apos;,[&apos;my-app.directives&apos;]);\n\nvar directives = angular.module(&apos;my-app.directives&apos;, []);\ndirectives.directive(&apos;slider&apos;, function() {\n    return {\n        link: function(scope, element, attrs) {\n            // Linking function.\n            // {{ initialize }}\n            // {{ event handler }}\n            // {{ scope updater }}\n            // {{ scope watcher }}\n        }\n    };\n});\n</code></pre><p>Directives teach HTML new tricks, allowing us to write reusable components and\nwidgets. The link function allows us to register event handlers and watches on\nthe scope, all binded to our template. <code>link</code> supplies the AngularJS scope,\nthe element acting as the directive template, and attributes of the element.</p>\n<p>##Initialize</p>\n<p>Let us get some initialization out of the way.</p>\n<pre><code>::js\n// Linking function.\nvar $element = $(element);\nvar $bar = $(&apos;span&apos;, $element);\nvar step = attrs.step;\n\nvar width;\nvar offset;\n\nvar mouseDown = false;\nelement.on(&apos;mousedown touchstart&apos;, function(evt) {\n    mouseDown = true;\n    if (!width) {\n        width = $element.width();\n    } if (!offset) {\n        offset = $bar.offset().left;\n    }\n});\n\nelement.on(&apos;mouseup touchend&apos;, function(evt) {\n    mouseDown = false;\n});\n</code></pre><p>This just allows us to determine whether the user is currently dragging the\nslider with a click or touch.</p>\n<p>##Event Handler</p>\n<p>Whenever the user drags the slider, we want to update its binded scope value.\nVice-versa, whenever the binded scope value changes, we want to visually\nupdate the slider’s fill.</p>\n<pre><code>::js\n// Throttle function to 1 call per 25ms for performance.\nelement.on(&apos;mousemove touchmove&apos;, _.throttle(function(evt) {\n    if (!mouseDown) {\n        // Don&apos;t drag the slider on mousemove hover, only on click-n-drag.\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Calculate distance of the cursor/finger from beginning of slider\n    var diff;\n    if (evt.pageX) {\n        diff = evt.pageX - offset;\n    } else {\n        diff = evt.originalEvent.touches[0].pageX - offset;\n    }\n</code></pre><p>Above is the math driving the slider. We want to calculate how far the slider\nis dragged relative to the max value of the slider, in terms of a percentage.</p>\n<p>##Scope Updater</p>\n<p>We then take that percentage of the max value to attain the slider’s value.\nThat value is then applied to the scope.</p>\n<pre><code>::js\n    // Allow dragging past the limits of the slider, but impose min/max values.\n    if (diff &lt; 0) {\n        scope.sliderValue = attrs.min;\n        $bar.width(&apos;0%&apos;);\n    } else if (diff &gt; width) {\n        scope.sliderValue = attrs.max;\n        $bar.width(&apos;100%&apos;);\n\n    // Set the value to percentage of slider filled against a max value.\n    } else {\n        var percent = diff / width;\n        $bar.width(percent * 100 + &apos;%&apos;);\n        scope.sliderValue = Math.round(percent * attrs.max / step) * step);\n    }\n\n    // Let all the watchers know we have updated the slider value.\n    scope.$apply();\n}, 25));\n</code></pre><p>We have enough to calculate the slider’s value.

There are other ways to syntactically bind the directive to\nthe element through the <code>restrict</code> parameter, we even make it look like a\n<code>&lt;slider&gt;</code> tag. Note that the following Javascript code snippets are parts\nof a whole.</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nvar myApp = angular.module(&apos;my-app&apos;,[&apos;my-app.directives&apos;]);\n\nvar directives = angular.module(&apos;my-app.directives&apos;, []);\ndirectives.directive(&apos;slider&apos;, function() {\n    return {\n        link: function(scope, element, attrs) {\n            // Linking function.\n            // {{ initialize }}\n            // {{ event handler }}\n            // {{ scope updater }}\n            // {{ scope watcher }}\n        }\n    };\n});\n</code></pre><p>Directives teach HTML new tricks, allowing us to write reusable components and\nwidgets. The link function allows us to register event handlers and watches on\nthe scope, all binded to our template. <code>link</code> supplies the AngularJS scope,\nthe element acting as the directive template, and attributes of the element.</p>\n<p>##Initialize</p>\n<p>Let us get some initialization out of the way.</p>\n<pre><code>::js\n// Linking function.\nvar $element = $(element);\nvar $bar = $(&apos;span&apos;, $element);\nvar step = attrs.step;\n\nvar width;\nvar offset;\n\nvar mouseDown = false;\nelement.on(&apos;mousedown touchstart&apos;, function(evt) {\n    mouseDown = true;\n    if (!width) {\n        width = $element.width();\n    } if (!offset) {\n        offset = $bar.offset().left;\n    }\n});\n\nelement.on(&apos;mouseup touchend&apos;, function(evt) {\n    mouseDown = false;\n});\n</code></pre><p>This just allows us to determine whether the user is currently dragging the\nslider with a click or touch.</p>\n<p>##Event Handler</p>\n<p>Whenever the user drags the slider, we want to update its binded scope value.\nVice-versa, whenever the binded scope value changes, we want to visually\nupdate the slider’s fill.</p>\n<pre><code>::js\n// Throttle function to 1 call per 25ms for performance.\nelement.on(&apos;mousemove touchmove&apos;, _.throttle(function(evt) {\n    if (!mouseDown) {\n        // Don&apos;t drag the slider on mousemove hover, only on click-n-drag.\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // Calculate distance of the cursor/finger from beginning of slider\n    var diff;\n    if (evt.pageX) {\n        diff = evt.pageX - offset;\n    } else {\n        diff = evt.originalEvent.touches[0].pageX - offset;\n    }\n</code></pre><p>Above is the math driving the slider. We want to calculate how far the slider\nis dragged relative to the max value of the slider, in terms of a percentage.</p>\n<p>##Scope Updater</p>\n<p>We then take that percentage of the max value to attain the slider’s value.\nThat value is then applied to the scope.</p>\n<pre><code>::js\n    // Allow dragging past the limits of the slider, but impose min/max values.\n    if (diff &lt; 0) {\n        scope.sliderValue = attrs.min;\n        $bar.width(&apos;0%&apos;);\n    } else if (diff &gt; width) {\n        scope.sliderValue = attrs.max;\n        $bar.width(&apos;100%&apos;);\n\n    // Set the value to percentage of slider filled against a max value.\n    } else {\n        var percent = diff / width;\n        $bar.width(percent * 100 + &apos;%&apos;);\n        scope.sliderValue = Math.round(percent * attrs.max / step) * step);\n    }\n\n    // Let all the watchers know we have updated the slider value.\n    scope.$apply();\n}, 25));\n</code></pre><p>We have enough to calculate the slider’s value. We set the width of the inner\nspan to create the visual effect of the slider, and update the scope’s slider\nvalue.</p>\n<p>##Scope Watcher</p>\n<p>This accomplishes one-way data binding; if we change the slider, we\nchange the slider’s value in the scope. But we also need to account for if the\nslider’s value in the scope is changed somewhere else, we need to visually\nupdate the slider. We accomplish this by registering a watcher on the scope.</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nscope.$watch(&apos;sliderValue&apos;, function(sliderValue) {\n    $bar.width(sliderValue / attrs.max * 100 + &apos;%&apos;);\n});\n</code></pre><p>When the slider’s value in the scope is updated somewhere else, the watcher\nwill trigger our callback function. We change the slider’s fill percentage to\nrespectively match the new slider value.</p>\n<p>##CSS</p>\n<p>Setting the width of the inner span changes the fill of the slider.</p>\n<pre><code>::scss\n.slider {\n    @include box-shadow(inset 0 -1px 1px rgba(255,255,255,0.3));\n    background: rgb(10, 10, 10)\n    border-radius: 5px;\n    height: 20px;\n    padding: 10px;\n    position: relative;\n    &gt; span {\n        @include gradient(rgb(43,194,83) 37%, rgb(84,240,84) 69%);\n        @include box-shadow(\n            inset 0 2px 9px  rgba(255,255,255,0.3)\\,\n            inset 0 -2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.4)\n        );\n        background-color: rgb(43,194,83);\n        border-radius: 20px 8px 8px 20px;\n        font-weight: bold;\n        display: block;\n        height: 100%;\n        overflow: hidden;\n        position: relative;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><p>To view the code, inspect the code for this page as I inlined it in the HTML.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Up-Next\"><a href=\"#Up-Next\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Up Next\"></a>Up Next</h2><p>By now you might have started on your own sweet AngularJS app. But testing is\nan important part of development.

It was my first ever real live poker tournament. There were enough\npeople to fill three tables, for approximately a pool of 30 players. At each\ntable were the handsome dealers, with regulars seated around, many donning the\nUnabomber look complete with shades and cap. I came in with the mindset to play\njust like it was online, no strings attached. I performed alright, considering.\nI ended up finishing in **5th** out of about 30, just past the bubble, walking\naway with $80 from a prize pool of $1300.\n\n---\n\nFor those curious enough to click through, I have written before about [my\nhistory with online poker](/blog/poker). Given the banning of online poker in\nthe States, live poker rooms were one of my only options to play. I had been\nlooking forward to visiting the place for a while. After a uneventful day at\nwork, I figured tonight was the night to try my hand.\n\n## Arriving at the Poker Club\n\nAt 9pm, I started walking half a mile from my studio towards the Encore Poker\nClub. I checked the schedule online, the $500-guaranteed was to start at 10pm.\nNow, I was well-rusted, having not played poker seriously since freshman year\nof college. I had earlier flipped through my copy of *Harrington on Hold'em,\nVolume 1*, the Koran for NLHE multi-table tournaments, hoping for all of my\nformer studies of the game to come back. I arrived at the front desk to\nregister.\n\n*\"First time, here, huh?\"*, the lady asked.\n\n*\"Yeah\"*, I sheepishly responded as I looked around the room. Half of the room\nwas lined with red-felted tables, the other half blue. TVs filled the wall,\neach televising a different sport.\n\nI took a seat to wait for the tourney to start. I pulled out my laptop and\nstarted coding a bit for work while I watched a Chicago vs. Denver basketball\ngame. It was sort of intimidating, being in this sort of atmosphere. Chips\nclinking with players at the tables bantering. I wasn't exactly sure how things\nworked, but I waited and finally sat.\n\nA TV near our table displayed the status of the tourney. It showed where my\nseat was (seat 4), stack sizes, blinds timer, payouts, etc. I felt pretty lost,\nI wasn't even exactly sure where seat 4 was. But I made my best guess.\n\n\"*This is seat 4, right?*\"\n\n\"*Yes, sir.*\"\n\n\"*Oh okay, I see. One, two, three...four*\" as I pointed at my seat.\n\n\"*Great! Next thing to learn is how to count your chips*\", another player joked.\n\nSeveral people sat down, not many, but more showed up late as they were knocked out\nfrom an adjacent tourney. Cards in the air!\n\n## Early Game\n\nThroughout the game, I was aware my image was as a complete noob, making\nfrequent faux pas such as string betting, forgetting to pass the button,\nthrowing in incorrect amounts of chips. But I used that image to my advantage\nby playing dumb. While I sometimes messed up phyiscally managing my chips, I\nwas a bit experienced with the game itself as a former micro-stakes grinder.\n\nBy the book, I started off tight. I observed how the table worked, how to make\ncalls, little things that players have to do live that they don't have to do\nonline.\n\nMy first hand, a few hands into the game, was some suited connector. I think I\nwas the preflop raiser, but I was check-raised by a middle pair on the turn,\ngetting pushed off my flush draw that would have hit.\n\nI barely said a word at the tables. Half because I am a pretty shy guy already,\nhalf because I was in a new environment where everyone seemed to know each\nother. They were comfortable, I wasn't completely, but I was getting there. Few\nmore hands passed, no pots won yet.\n\nIt was then break time, which I used to Facetime my girlfriend a good night as\nshe wished me good luck.\n\n## Inducing a Value Bluff\n\nI get dealt **A9o** in middle position. I raise the standard 3xBB and get one\ncall from the small blind. He was a regular that briefly introduced himself to\nme before the game. He seemed the most comfortable of all the players, simply\nlistening to music on his earbuds. The flop hits **Axx**, a dry board with top-\npair. He leads out with a bet. I think a bit, whether I should raise with top-\npair. Given how dry the board was, I opted to slowplay so I flat-call. The turn\nis a blank. He checks, indicating that his lead was a semi-bluff. I check back,\nnot wanting to scare him away and seeing if I could induce a small value bluff.\nIndeed, he makes a bets on the river and I call. He shows a low pair, and I\ntake a healthy pot.\n\n## Stacking with AA\n\nLater, I was dealt **AA**. My hands shook. I open preflop and get a call from a\nyoung Indian shortstack. A few bets and raises, and he was all-in. The aces\nheld, and I stacked him, bringing me to about 8.5k chips (started with 7k).\n\n## Fumbling with the Nuts\n\nThe poker gods later deal me **AA** again. I stay a bit more calm than the last\ntime, and make a preflop raise. One caller, a sort of tomboyish lady with the\nvibe of a regular. The flop comes **Axx**, the nut top set. I slowly go to make\na bet. Though I made a mistake, I counted my chips out above the line, which I\ncould have been called for. I even put in the wrong number of chips that I\nverbally called. Though, the dealer gave me a break as I was clearly like a\nvirgin here. I glanced over and saw she had barely any chips remaining and\nmoved to put her all in. Third mistake of the hand, I was too eager and moved\nout of turn. Though she was going all in anyways, smiling at me \"*You're fine,\nhoney.*\". The top set held, and I stacked another player.\n\nSomewhat funnily remarked they had only seen me play two hands, and both times\nI held aces. \"*Not much to it*\", I said.\n\nThere was a player to my left. We'll call him Phil since he had a deeply voice\nlike Phil Laak, wearing shades and a beanie. \"*I can't believe this is his\nfirst tournament*\", Phil remarked at my faux pas as I gathered my chips,\n\"*Though, he's obviously good online*\", he said to the other players.\n\n## Side-Pot Etiquette\n\nIn the mid-game, I opened in position with **56s**. A really short stack,\nraised me for not much more to go all in. Phil calls, creating a side-pot. The\nflop doesn't hit, but I make a standard continuation bet. Phil folds, telling\nme he caught a piece of the flop, and that I better have something to knock the\nother guy out. I showed revealed, and people sort of groaned as I had blank.\nMore groans came as I caught a 5 on the river to knock the guy out.\n\nIt's poker etiquette to not bluff when a third player is already all-in since\nthe goal of a tourney is to knock players out. The correct move is usually to\ncheck it down. So Phil gave me a friendly explanation about it. I used to be a\ncash game player so my only thought was to win hands, but in tournaments it is\noften in the best interests to knock players out. Though there was some warrant\nto my move, he said, as I gained a healthy amount of chips. He later apologized\nand said we had gotten off on the wrong foot.\n\nI then knock out a middle-aged man with **QQ** over **TT** all in preflop after\nmy 3-bet.\n\n## The Final Table\n\nWhen it got down to 10, the three tables combined into the final table down to\n10. Though not for long. Two players quickly get knocked out. Then two more.\nOnly four get to be in the money here.\n\nMy stack replenished as I was dealt **AJ** and deal continuation bet against\ntwo players as I hit **Jxx**.\n\nI knock out Phil from the small blind in a coin-flip with **JJ** over **AKo**\nwhere I had 3-bet him against the button. I thinking somewhere inside he was a\nlittle bit tilted, a noob like me seemingly to be lucking out while he was\ndealt coolers.\n\n\"*Good playing with you*\", I mutter, one of the few words I mutter for the\nwhole tournament.\n\n\"*Yeah, good luck. You're a good player*\", he replied kindly, though I'm not\nsure there was a hint of sarcasm.\n\nAnd then there were five. Final hand before the third break, I open with\n**QAo**. The flop misses me, though wet with all clubs. I check through to the\nturn, seeing no value in c-betting. I was going to poke the turn as the board\npaired, though an older guy with a mustache wearing a Ducks hat pushed me out\nwith an underpair. Break time.\n\n## Walk of Shame\n\nAfter the break, all the players agreed to pay the bubble, meaning the next\nplayer to get knocked out would still walk out with an agreed-upon amount of\nmoney, $80. First place would receive $550, then $360, then $240, then $160. I\nhad a healthy stack at this point and thought I would make it to at least the\ntop three.\n\nBut the blinds raised viciously, I wasn't getting good enough hands to steal\nblinds to stay alive. Before I knew it, the blinds were $3k/$6k, and my stack\ndwindled down to only 3 big blinds.\n\nI shoved on the button with **A2o**, hoping to get a quick blind steal. But the\nsmall blind, a late-20s Asian guy with a leather jacket, called with *KK*. He\nhad almost been knocked out several times, but doubled up several times all in\nas the poker gods smiled on him. \"*Good luck*\", everyone wished, well, wishing\nI would get knocked out to guarantee them more money.\n\nAn ace hit on the flop, only to be crushed by a *K* on the turn. And that was\nall she wrote. \"*Good hand*\".\n\nI received the payout and walked home in the cold, a bit upset about how that\nended, to go so far. It was sort of like blue balls, being close to a large sum\nof money. I regretted not being more aggressive in the later rounds, thinking I\ncould sit my way to more cash.\n\nBut, you know what, I finished 5th out of 30 at my very first live poker\ntournament, where people actually knew how to play. I'm excited to get better,\nlearn the etiquette, and come back again sometime. Maybe even tomorrow since\ntickets to the basketball game I wanted to see costs the same as the buy-in the\na $5,000 guaranteed tomorrow. Fortunately they air the basketball games there.\n\nIf nothing else, tonight was good practice for the day I test my fishing at the\n**Bellagio** this holiday season.\n\n+$50\n","source":"_posts/037_pokeritm.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"Poker Session #1: My First Live Cash\"\ntype: blog\ncategory: blog\ndate: 2013-11-22\nid: \"poker-live\"\ntags: poker\n\nimage:\n    url: http://i.imgur.com/YOG0wka.jpg\n    where: top\n---\n\nI went out tonight to Encore Poker Club, a casino style poker room, in NW\nPortland to play in a $500-guaranteed, $30 buy-in NLHE multi-table tournament\n(MTT).

It was my first ever real live poker tournament. There were enough\npeople to fill three tables, for approximately a pool of 30 players. At each\ntable were the handsome dealers, with regulars seated around, many donning the\nUnabomber look complete with shades and cap. I came in with the mindset to play\njust like it was online, no strings attached. I performed alright, considering.\nI ended up finishing in <strong>5th</strong> out of about 30, just past the bubble, walking\naway with $80 from a prize pool of $1300.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For those curious enough to click through, I have written before about <a href=\"/blog/poker\">my\nhistory with online poker</a>. Given the banning of online poker in\nthe States, live poker rooms were one of my only options to play. I had been\nlooking forward to visiting the place for a while. After a uneventful day at\nwork, I figured tonight was the night to try my hand.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Arriving-at-the-Poker-Club\"><a href=\"#Arriving-at-the-Poker-Club\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Arriving at the Poker Club\"></a>Arriving at the Poker Club</h2><p>At 9pm, I started walking half a mile from my studio towards the Encore Poker\nClub. I checked the schedule online, the $500-guaranteed was to start at 10pm.\nNow, I was well-rusted, having not played poker seriously since freshman year\nof college. I had earlier flipped through my copy of <em>Harrington on Hold’em,\nVolume 1</em>, the Koran for NLHE multi-table tournaments, hoping for all of my\nformer studies of the game to come back. I arrived at the front desk to\nregister.</p>\n<p><em>“First time, here, huh?”</em>, the lady asked.</p>\n<p><em>“Yeah”</em>, I sheepishly responded as I looked around the room. Half of the room\nwas lined with red-felted tables, the other half blue. TVs filled the wall,\neach televising a different sport.</p>\n<p>I took a seat to wait for the tourney to start. I pulled out my laptop and\nstarted coding a bit for work while I watched a Chicago vs. Denver basketball\ngame. It was sort of intimidating, being in this sort of atmosphere. Chips\nclinking with players at the tables bantering. I wasn’t exactly sure how things\nworked, but I waited and finally sat.</p>\n<p>A TV near our table displayed the status of the tourney. It showed where my\nseat was (seat 4), stack sizes, blinds timer, payouts, etc. I felt pretty lost,\nI wasn’t even exactly sure where seat 4 was. But I made my best guess.</p>\n<p>“<em>This is seat 4, right?</em>“</p>\n<p>“<em>Yes, sir.</em>“</p>\n<p>“<em>Oh okay, I see. One, two, three…four</em>“ as I pointed at my seat.</p>\n<p>“<em>Great! Next thing to learn is how to count your chips</em>“, another player joked.</p>\n<p>Several people sat down, not many, but more showed up late as they were knocked out\nfrom an adjacent tourney. Cards in the air!</p>\n<h2 id=\"Early-Game\"><a href=\"#Early-Game\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Early Game\"></a>Early Game</h2><p>Throughout the game, I was aware my image was as a complete noob, making\nfrequent faux pas such as string betting, forgetting to pass the button,\nthrowing in incorrect amounts of chips. But I used that image to my advantage\nby playing dumb. While I sometimes messed up phyiscally managing my chips, I\nwas a bit experienced with the game itself as a former micro-stakes grinder.</p>\n<p>By the book, I started off tight. I observed how the table worked, how to make\ncalls, little things that players have to do live that they don’t have to do\nonline.</p>\n<p>My first hand, a few hands into the game, was some suited connector. I think I\nwas the preflop raiser, but I was check-raised by a middle pair on the turn,\ngetting pushed off my flush draw that would have hit.</p>\n<p>I barely said a word at the tables. Half because I am a pretty shy guy already,\nhalf because I was in a new environment where everyone seemed to know each\nother. They were comfortable, I wasn’t completely, but I was getting there. Few\nmore hands passed, no pots won yet.</p>\n<p>It was then break time, which I used to Facetime my girlfriend a good night as\nshe wished me good luck.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Inducing-a-Value-Bluff\"><a href=\"#Inducing-a-Value-Bluff\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Inducing a Value Bluff\"></a>Inducing a Value Bluff</h2><p>I get dealt <strong>A9o</strong> in middle position. I raise the standard 3xBB and get one\ncall from the small blind. He was a regular that briefly introduced himself to\nme before the game. He seemed the most comfortable of all the players, simply\nlistening to music on his earbuds. The flop hits <strong>Axx</strong>, a dry board with top-\npair. He leads out with a bet. I think a bit, whether I should raise with top-\npair. Given how dry the board was, I opted to slowplay so I flat-call. The turn\nis a blank. He checks, indicating that his lead was a semi-bluff. I check back,\nnot wanting to scare him away and seeing if I could induce a small value bluff.\nIndeed, he makes a bets on the river and I call. He shows a low pair, and I\ntake a healthy pot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Stacking-with-AA\"><a href=\"#Stacking-with-AA\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Stacking with AA\"></a>Stacking with AA</h2><p>Later, I was dealt <strong>AA</strong>. My hands shook. I open preflop and get a call from a\nyoung Indian shortstack. A few bets and raises, and he was all-in. The aces\nheld, and I stacked him, bringing me to about 8.5k chips (started with 7k).</p>\n<h2 id=\"Fumbling-with-the-Nuts\"><a href=\"#Fumbling-with-the-Nuts\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Fumbling with the Nuts\"></a>Fumbling with the Nuts</h2><p>The poker gods later deal me <strong>AA</strong> again. I stay a bit more calm than the last\ntime, and make a preflop raise. One caller, a sort of tomboyish lady with the\nvibe of a regular. The flop comes <strong>Axx</strong>, the nut top set. I slowly go to make\na bet. Though I made a mistake, I counted my chips out above the line, which I\ncould have been called for. I even put in the wrong number of chips that I\nverbally called. Though, the dealer gave me a break as I was clearly like a\nvirgin here. I glanced over and saw she had barely any chips remaining and\nmoved to put her all in. Third mistake of the hand, I was too eager and moved\nout of turn. Though she was going all in anyways, smiling at me “<em>You’re fine,\nhoney.</em>“. The top set held, and I stacked another player.</p>\n<p>Somewhat funnily remarked they had only seen me play two hands, and both times\nI held aces. “<em>Not much to it</em>“, I said.</p>\n<p>There was a player to my left. We’ll call him Phil since he had a deeply voice\nlike Phil Laak, wearing shades and a beanie. “<em>I can’t believe this is his\nfirst tournament</em>“, Phil remarked at my faux pas as I gathered my chips,\n“<em>Though, he’s obviously good online</em>“, he said to the other players.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Side-Pot-Etiquette\"><a href=\"#Side-Pot-Etiquette\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Side-Pot Etiquette\"></a>Side-Pot Etiquette</h2><p>In the mid-game, I opened in position with <strong>56s</strong>. A really short stack,\nraised me for not much more to go all in. Phil calls, creating a side-pot. The\nflop doesn’t hit, but I make a standard continuation bet. Phil folds, telling\nme he caught a piece of the flop, and that I better have something to knock the\nother guy out. I showed revealed, and people sort of groaned as I had blank.\nMore groans came as I caught a 5 on the river to knock the guy out.</p>\n<p>It’s poker etiquette to not bluff when a third player is already all-in since\nthe goal of a tourney is to knock players out. The correct move is usually to\ncheck it down. So Phil gave me a friendly explanation about it. I used to be a\ncash game player so my only thought was to win hands, but in tournaments it is\noften in the best interests to knock players out. Though there was some warrant\nto my move, he said, as I gained a healthy amount of chips. He later apologized\nand said we had gotten off on the wrong foot.</p>\n<p>I then knock out a middle-aged man with <strong>QQ</strong> over <strong>TT</strong> all in preflop after\nmy 3-bet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The-Final-Table\"><a href=\"#The-Final-Table\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The Final Table\"></a>The Final Table</h2><p>When it got down to 10, the three tables combined into the final table down to</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Though not for long.

Don't know other frameworks, don't care.\n- ```browser``` - since we're unit testing, generally set this to ```PhantomJS``` so\n                 it doesn't pop up a browser every run.\n\nThen we can start the Karma runner to run our tests.\n\n    karma start karma.config.js\n\n## Writing Jasmine Unit Tests\n\nJasmine unit tests, to me, are just like any other unit testing framework, but\nmore designed to be read like English. In essence it is the same, there are\ntest suites, test cases, setups, teardowns, and mocking. Here is\n[my entire unit test for reference.](https://github.com/ngokevin/minimalist/blob/060a3bbc082f10d8305ef97871911b20f073e472/tests/unit_tests/services.tests.js)\n\nThe [Jasmine docs](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) should be your primary\nsource for learning what the tests look like, but here is an excerpt from my\nown.\n\n    ::js\n    describe('ItemService', function() {\n        var store = {};\n        var ls = function() {\n            return JSON.parse(store.storage);\n        };\n\n        beforeEach(function() {\n            // setUp.\n            module('MinimalistApp');\n\n            // LocalStorage mock.\n            spyOn(localStorage, 'getItem').andCallFake(function(key) {\n                return store[key];\n            });\n            Object.defineProperty(sessionStorage, \"setItem\", { writable: true });\n            spyOn(localStorage, 'setItem').andCallFake(function(key, value) {\n                store[key] = value;\n            });\n        });\n\n        afterEach(function () {\n            store = {};\n        });\n\n        it('migrate from legacy to version 0.', function() {\n            store = {\n                lastViewedList: 0,\n                lists: ['sample', 'sample_two'],\n                sample: {\n                    id: 0,\n                    list: [\n                        {\n                            id: 1,\n                            items: ['item1', 'item2'],\n                            rank: 2\n                        },\n                        {\n                            id: 2,\n                            items: ['item3', 'item4'],\n                            rank: 1\n                        }\n                    ]\n                },\n                sample_two: {\n                    id: 1,\n                    list: [\n                        {\n                            id: 1,\n                            items: ['item5'],\n                            rank: 1,\n                        }\n                    ]\n                },\n\n            };\n            localStorage.setItem('storage', JSON.stringify(store));\n\n            inject(function(ItemService) {\n                var sample = ItemService.getList(0);\n                expect(sample.itemIndex.length, 2);\n                expect(sample.items[0].text).toEqual('item3\\nitem4');\n                expect(sample.items[1].text).toEqual('item1\\nitem2');\n\n                sample = ItemService.getLists()[1];\n                expect(sample.itemIndex.length, 1);\n                expect(sample.items[0].text).toEqual('item5');\n            });\n        });\n    });\n\n### Initializing a Jasmine Test Suite\n\nI'll describe portions of the code starting from the top.\n\n    ::js\n    describe('ItemService', function() {\n        // ...\n    });\n\n### Setup and Mocking LocalStorage\n\nThis initializes our test suite for our module.\n\n    ::js\n    var store = {};\n    beforeEach(function() {\n        // setUp.\n        module('MinimalistApp');\n\n        // LocalStorage mock.\n        spyOn(localStorage, 'getItem').andCallFake(function(key) {\n            return store[key];\n        });\n        Object.defineProperty(sessionStorage, \"setItem\", { writable: true });\n        spyOn(localStorage, 'setItem').andCallFake(function(key, value) {\n            store[key] = value;\n        });\n    });\n\nThe setup called before each test case for initialization. We mock out our app\nwith Angular Mock's ```module``` to allow us to inject, or import, the modules or\npieces of our code that we wish to test.\n\nThen we set up our Local Storage mock. we use Jasmine's ```spyOn``` to mock\n```localStorage.getItem``` and ```localStorage.setItem```. This watches for\ncalls to these methods, and instead of calling the code it normally runs, it'll\ninstead call the function that we pass into ```andCallFake```. Here, the\nfunctions we pass into ```andCallFake``` simply interact with a plain\nJavascript object, ```store```. We have mocked our Local Storage with a\nJavascript object, making infinitely easier to test. Everything is under our\ncontrol. If you wish to mock Local Storage as well, definitely steal this code\nsnippet.\n\n    ::js\n    afterEach(function () {\n        store = {};\n    });\n\n### Jasmine Test Cases\n\nThe teardown called after each test case to reset the state. Here, we basically\nclear our Local Storage.\n\n    ::js\n    it('migrate from legacy to version 0.', function() {\n        // ...\n    });\n\n### Injecting Angular Modules\n\nA single test case. The test case is created with ```it``` where we pass in  a\nstring describing the behavior we are testing and the test case itself.\n\n    inject(function(ItemService) {\n        var sample = ItemService.getList(0);\n        expect(sample.itemIndex.length, 2);\n        expect(sample.items[0].text).toEqual('item3\\nitem4');\n        expect(sample.items[1].text).toEqual('item1\\nitem2');\n\n        sample = ItemService.getLists()[1];\n        expect(sample.itemIndex.length, 1);\n        expect(sample.items[0].text).toEqual('item5');\n    });\n\nAfter some test case setup code, we finally get to the juicy test assertions.\nWe call Angular Mock's ```inject``` to import our service into the test case. I\nassume the Angular app module namespace is searched to pull out the module so\nmake sure the parameter name matches what we want to import.\n\n### Jasmine Assertions\n\nTo run a basic assertion, we call Jasmine's ```expect```, passing in the first\nvalue, and then ```toEqual``` to assert that its value is equivalent to what we\nexpect. Jasmine is interesting how everything is modeled after being an English\nsentence.\n\nThat's all.

We mock out our app\nwith Angular Mock's ```module``` to allow us to inject, or import, the modules or\npieces of our code that we wish to test.\n\nThen we set up our Local Storage mock. we use Jasmine's ```spyOn``` to mock\n```localStorage.getItem``` and ```localStorage.setItem```. This watches for\ncalls to these methods, and instead of calling the code it normally runs, it'll\ninstead call the function that we pass into ```andCallFake```. Here, the\nfunctions we pass into ```andCallFake``` simply interact with a plain\nJavascript object, ```store```. We have mocked our Local Storage with a\nJavascript object, making infinitely easier to test. Everything is under our\ncontrol. If you wish to mock Local Storage as well, definitely steal this code\nsnippet.\n\n    ::js\n    afterEach(function () {\n        store = {};\n    });\n\n### Jasmine Test Cases\n\nThe teardown called after each test case to reset the state. Here, we basically\nclear our Local Storage.\n\n    ::js\n    it('migrate from legacy to version 0.', function() {\n        // ...\n    });\n\n### Injecting Angular Modules\n\nA single test case. The test case is created with ```it``` where we pass in  a\nstring describing the behavior we are testing and the test case itself.\n\n    inject(function(ItemService) {\n        var sample = ItemService.getList(0);\n        expect(sample.itemIndex.length, 2);\n        expect(sample.items[0].text).toEqual('item3\\nitem4');\n        expect(sample.items[1].text).toEqual('item1\\nitem2');\n\n        sample = ItemService.getLists()[1];\n        expect(sample.itemIndex.length, 1);\n        expect(sample.items[0].text).toEqual('item5');\n    });\n\nAfter some test case setup code, we finally get to the juicy test assertions.\nWe call Angular Mock's ```inject``` to import our service into the test case. I\nassume the Angular app module namespace is searched to pull out the module so\nmake sure the parameter name matches what we want to import.\n\n### Jasmine Assertions\n\nTo run a basic assertion, we call Jasmine's ```expect```, passing in the first\nvalue, and then ```toEqual``` to assert that its value is equivalent to what we\nexpect. Jasmine is interesting how everything is modeled after being an English\nsentence.\n\nThat's all.

Final Table is\nconveniently close to my parent's place (half a mile), similar to how the\n[Encore Poker Club](http://www.encoreclub.com/) is conveniently close to my\nstudio (half a mile). Donkaments always readily available. I cashed in both\nfreerolls with a 1st place finish for $355 and $235. Just played\ntight-aggressive in the early-to-middle stages and transitioned to short-stack\nand bubble play as the 15-minute blinds quickly ramped up. Continuing the\nsuccess from [Poker Session #2](/blog/poker2).\n\n---\n\n![venue pano](http://i.imgur.com/nY64p22.jpg)\n\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nPano- of the venue.\n</span></div>\n\n## 11am Freeroll #1 - 1st Place for $355\n\nAfter making the 1h30m drive from Corvallis, I made it in time to register for\nthe 11am. Took the $15 pre-addon (as always) to give me a deep stack and a 1k\nchip bonus to start with 7k instead of 1.5k chips.\n\nI sat, where someone immediately commented me on my outfit (charcoal quilted\njacket, grey henley, jeans). Though it was pretty much all I had to wear after\ncoming back from Corvallis. I bantered with a talkative Broncos/Knicks fan\nabout sports for a while. He was seated next to a Seahawks fan, which brought\nsome lively conversation.\n\nOnce play started, I focused on trying to gain reads. For example, I noticed\nthe player two seats right limp under-the-gun with A9s, then took a stab at the\npot on the turn. Though I never used this read, I could classify him a\nloose-passive fish with a wide limping range from all positions.\n\nMy stack was pretty small most of the first table but I made by by stealing\nwith premium hands and showing them to gain later fold equity.\n\n### 11am Freeroll #1 - Final Table\n\nEventually, I made it to the final table, having played the tournament\nmostly short-stacked due to the increasing blinds and not getting many\nplayable hands. I had 35k chips with the blinds at 2k/4k, an M-ratio of 6\naccording to Harrington. That means I was reduced to push/shove play. We sat\nat the special final table, an elevated platform with rails around the edges\nfor spectators.\n\nI focused on stealing with open shoves. Each successful steal with increase my\nstack by almost 20%. It was folded around, I stole from the button with J2s.\nThe next hand, I open-shoved again from the cut-off, this time with AQo. The\nbutton, a black man with cap and dreads, who contemplated calling my shove last\nhand, called this time with 78s. My AQo held to knock him out. Double up to ~75k.\n\nI shoved all-in again with AQo. Which held against a short-stack's 88 after it\nhit a set on the flop, but I hit a straight on the turn. My stack was about at\n~110k.\n\nWe got down to five people when we negotiated paying the bubble. We mostly all\nagreed on $45 for fifth place, with $5 tip to the dealer. But a old Asian guy,\nwith large glasses, a cap, and his cheering wife at courtside, yelled *\"I NO\nPAY BUBBLE $40, NOT $45\"*, in a strong obnoxious accent. We all kind of looked\nat each other strangely, *\"okay...\"*. We agreed on $40 after someone argued so\nstrongly over $5 less, enough for about a cup of coffee.\n\n### 11am Freeroll #1 - Captain Ahab\n\nThere was a big Italian mafia-like guy at the table, a lag-tard whale who was\nhitting all of his cards. We'll call him Moby. I remembered at the first table\nhim raising with 45o and such and getting hit in the face with the board. I\nmouth watered then, but didn't get any cards to hunt Moby. He had accumulated a\nlot of chips by the time he got to the final table, but it was not worth much\nanymore at the heavy blinds. Plus I was about chip leader at this point. Moby\ndidn't really understand turbo tournaments, min-raising when a min-raise was\nabout a third to half of his stack, not adjusting to blind levels.\n\nAlthough I was chip leader, my M-ratio was just barely over 6. I was still\ngoing to play shove-fold. I shoved A3o on the button which held and busted the\nbig blind's KTs. Then I got heads up with Moby. Spectators were commenting\nand pointing at me, recognizing I came into the final table with rags, and made\nit to heads up with riches against the whale. I had played the final again as\nthe Silent Assassin, but now it was time to go **Captain Ahab**.\n\nI shoved with Q2o on the button to pick up his big blind (which was about a\nsixth of stacks). I stole again with K5s when he limped from the button. I\nfinally claimed the blubber when I shoved Q2o and he called with 99. In his\nanger, I hit a Q to take home the whale bacon. My first first-place finish,\nafter getting sucked out on last session for a second-place finish.\n\n![firstplace](http://i.imgur.com/TLh3Dcc.jpg)\n\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nResults of the 11am freeroll.\n</span></div>\n\n## 5pm Freeroll #2 - 1st for $235\n\nI opted-out of the 1pm $2000 guaranteed (which ended up lasting 8 hours) to\nchill at my parent's place with my brothers, waiting for the second freeroll at\n5pm.\n\nCame back later and registered. At the club, I recognized someone I had seen at\nthe other club, Encore, a mini-Filipino-Scotty-Nguyen that I had played with\nbefore, but didn't get a chance to say hi.\n\nThe early stages was full of action. Since it was freeroll, a guy was shoving\nblind every UTG, and kept holding. We'll call him D'Angelo Barksdale for the\nresemblance. Suspciously he kept showing up with AJ-AK hands, or would show up\nwith 34o to hold. Unfortunately, I didn't get a hand to play the streets with\nD'Angelo. The guy on my right got knocked out and must've rebought five times\ndue to D'Angelo's mischief.\n\nThrough this game, I maintained a healthy stack, around the average, despite\nthe increasing 15-minute blinds. The dealer was clumsy, and the table had\nseveral characters. One of which was Chicago (his table name was actually\nChicago), a big black man dressed in blue with a toy car as a hole protector.\nJust like Moby, he kept getting lucky with his questionable all-in calls.\nEvery time he won these big gambles (which was often), he would yell across\nthe club:\n\n*\"I am the 52-card player! And again, I am still. In. The hizz-ouse!\".*\n\nI would see him made men's faces look down in disgust as he busted several and\nloudly rubbed it in. We went to final table where I had direct positon on him.\n\nThere was also some talk about collusion going on at the $2000 tournament,\nwhere two players were soft-playing (open-folding TT/AKs as short-stack) each\nother and showing each other hold cards. They were almost kicked out. But looks\nlike one of them went on to take the $1.5k first-place prize.\n\n### 5pm Freeroll #2 - The Great Chicago Fire\n\nMy stack was a healthy average, my M-ratio was still about 8, so I had a little\nroom for flop play. I had Q7o on the button and raised 2.5x (4k) for a steal.\nThe small-blind, an old weak-tight player (not sure if he was all there)\ncalled.  The board came 269 two-tone. He checked, and I made a continuation\n(half-pot 4k). He floated so I elected to shut it down after a quick thought\nabout barrelling the paired turn. I checked back. The river gave me a pair of\n7s, and I checked for showdown value to take it down.\n\nEventually, we made it five-way. Chicago refused to pay the bubble,\nback-to-back messy bubble negotations. I kept a healthy stack, shoving and\nstealing once in a while to become chip leader. Chicago double-busted two\nplayers for turn it three-way, the other guy being a normal guy in a cap,\ndidn't have much reads on him, but he wasn't a total fish. Let's call him Joe.\n\nI bullied a bit being the big stack. I shoved KTo on the button, getting\nChicago to call with his Q6o. He caught up on the river, and again yelled:\n\n*\"I am the 52-card player! And again, I am still. In. The hizz-ouse!\".*\n\nChicago pushed later. I flat-called his raise getting it in ahead, but Joe\nsadly folded, despite to me winking to him that we could check it down to bust\nhim. Unfortunately, a couple hands later, he sucked out on me on the river\nagain:\n\n*\"I am the 52-card player! And again, I am still. In. The hizz-ouse!\".*\n\nMaking me the short-stack at ~40k chips out of a total of ~235k chips when\nI earlier had ~120k chips. But I stayed mentally stable, unfazed, silent.\nAs short-stack, I began to play aggressively. Each steal would increase my\nstack 50%. I shoved about 4 times, all being successful steals. Including\nopen shoves on the button, and shoving over a small blind limp.\n\nI made a small double-up against Joe with a 88 over AQo flip.\n\nI picked up A9o on the button and raised to 2.5x. The other guy, smartly folded\nwith only 2 big blinds left from the small blind, letting us two big stacks\ntake each other out. Chicago called from the big blind. I had him covered at\nthis point. The flop came Axx, and he donk-shoved all-in, where I immediately\nsnap-called. Aces held. I mocked to myself:\n\n*\"I have 53 cards, and I have 43 hizz-ouses or something...\"*\n\nChicago was busted.\n\n### 5pm Freeroll #2 - Taking It Home\n\nIt was heads-up against Joe and me. He was proud making that smart laydown\nto bump up the pay structure with only 2 big blinds, a decision that netted him\nan extra $35. He had less than 2 big blinds at this point. The match was\nalready decided, and we both knew it. The rest was a formality.\n\nHe won the first flip.\n\nI shoved AJs and he had no choice but to call with Q8o. Board rolled, KTxx.\nHe wished to the poker gods:\n\n*\"give me a Q, give me a Q\"*\n\nAnd the river came a Q. He looked initially happy before I pointed out I rolled\nout a straight. We both chuckled, and went to cash out, happy that we made it\nover Chicago. I went home with my back-to-back first place finishes. I play\nagain Friday.\n\n![firstplace2](http://i.imgur.com/lTNZLBI.jpg)\n\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nResults of the 5pm freeroll.\n</span></div>\n\n## Session Conclusion\n\n- **Went Well**: folding ATo in the small blind instead of stealing\n                 because the guy was confidently stacking his chips.\n- **Mistakes**: successful and frequent shove-steals during the bubble to build\n                stack.\n- **Get Better At**: Independent Chip Model theory, double-barreling.\n- **Profit**: +$560\n\n![wallet](http://i.imgur.com/w8Nt2xl.jpg)\n\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\n$560 from today, $265 from last week, to the point the wallet can't hold itself\nclosed.\n</span></div>\n","source":"_posts/042_poker3.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"Poker Session #3 - First and First\"\ntype: blog\ncategory: blog\ndate: 2014-01-25\nid: poker3\ntags: poker\n\nimage:\n    url: http://i.imgur.com/foOit2i.jpg\n    caption: Final Table Poker Club.\n---\n\nI spent another Saturday playing two 30-man $300 guaranteed turbo freerolls at\nthe [Final Table Poker Club](http://pokerportland.com).

At the club, I recognized someone I had seen at\nthe other club, Encore, a mini-Filipino-Scotty-Nguyen that I had played with\nbefore, but didn't get a chance to say hi.\n\nThe early stages was full of action. Since it was freeroll, a guy was shoving\nblind every UTG, and kept holding. We'll call him D'Angelo Barksdale for the\nresemblance. Suspciously he kept showing up with AJ-AK hands, or would show up\nwith 34o to hold. Unfortunately, I didn't get a hand to play the streets with\nD'Angelo. The guy on my right got knocked out and must've rebought five times\ndue to D'Angelo's mischief.\n\nThrough this game, I maintained a healthy stack, around the average, despite\nthe increasing 15-minute blinds. The dealer was clumsy, and the table had\nseveral characters. One of which was Chicago (his table name was actually\nChicago), a big black man dressed in blue with a toy car as a hole protector.\nJust like Moby, he kept getting lucky with his questionable all-in calls.\nEvery time he won these big gambles (which was often), he would yell across\nthe club:\n\n*\"I am the 52-card player! And again, I am still. In. The hizz-ouse!\".*\n\nI would see him made men's faces look down in disgust as he busted several and\nloudly rubbed it in. We went to final table where I had direct positon on him.\n\nThere was also some talk about collusion going on at the $2000 tournament,\nwhere two players were soft-playing (open-folding TT/AKs as short-stack) each\nother and showing each other hold cards. They were almost kicked out. But looks\nlike one of them went on to take the $1.5k first-place prize.\n\n### 5pm Freeroll #2 - The Great Chicago Fire\n\nMy stack was a healthy average, my M-ratio was still about 8, so I had a little\nroom for flop play. I had Q7o on the button and raised 2.5x (4k) for a steal.\nThe small-blind, an old weak-tight player (not sure if he was all there)\ncalled.  The board came 269 two-tone. He checked, and I made a continuation\n(half-pot 4k). He floated so I elected to shut it down after a quick thought\nabout barrelling the paired turn. I checked back. The river gave me a pair of\n7s, and I checked for showdown value to take it down.\n\nEventually, we made it five-way. Chicago refused to pay the bubble,\nback-to-back messy bubble negotations. I kept a healthy stack, shoving and\nstealing once in a while to become chip leader. Chicago double-busted two\nplayers for turn it three-way, the other guy being a normal guy in a cap,\ndidn't have much reads on him, but he wasn't a total fish. Let's call him Joe.\n\nI bullied a bit being the big stack. I shoved KTo on the button, getting\nChicago to call with his Q6o. He caught up on the river, and again yelled:\n\n*\"I am the 52-card player! And again, I am still. In. The hizz-ouse!\".*\n\nChicago pushed later. I flat-called his raise getting it in ahead, but Joe\nsadly folded, despite to me winking to him that we could check it down to bust\nhim. Unfortunately, a couple hands later, he sucked out on me on the river\nagain:\n\n*\"I am the 52-card player! And again, I am still. In. The hizz-ouse!\".*\n\nMaking me the short-stack at ~40k chips out of a total of ~235k chips when\nI earlier had ~120k chips. But I stayed mentally stable, unfazed, silent.\nAs short-stack, I began to play aggressively. Each steal would increase my\nstack 50%. I shoved about 4 times, all being successful steals. Including\nopen shoves on the button, and shoving over a small blind limp.\n\nI made a small double-up against Joe with a 88 over AQo flip.\n\nI picked up A9o on the button and raised to 2.5x. The other guy, smartly folded\nwith only 2 big blinds left from the small blind, letting us two big stacks\ntake each other out. Chicago called from the big blind. I had him covered at\nthis point. The flop came Axx, and he donk-shoved all-in, where I immediately\nsnap-called. Aces held. I mocked to myself:\n\n*\"I have 53 cards, and I have 43 hizz-ouses or something...\"*\n\nChicago was busted.\n\n### 5pm Freeroll #2 - Taking It Home\n\nIt was heads-up against Joe and me. He was proud making that smart laydown\nto bump up the pay structure with only 2 big blinds, a decision that netted him\nan extra $35. He had less than 2 big blinds at this point. The match was\nalready decided, and we both knew it. The rest was a formality.\n\nHe won the first flip.\n\nI shoved AJs and he had no choice but to call with Q8o. Board rolled, KTxx.\nHe wished to the poker gods:\n\n*\"give me a Q, give me a Q\"*\n\nAnd the river came a Q. He looked initially happy before I pointed out I rolled\nout a straight. We both chuckled, and went to cash out, happy that we made it\nover Chicago. I went home with my back-to-back first place finishes. I play\nagain Friday.\n\n![firstplace2](http://i.imgur.com/lTNZLBI.jpg)\n\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nResults of the 5pm freeroll.\n</span></div>\n\n## Session Conclusion\n\n- **Went Well**: folding ATo in the small blind instead of stealing\n                 because the guy was confidently stacking his chips.\n- **Mistakes**: successful and frequent shove-steals during the bubble to build\n                stack.\n- **Get Better At**: Independent Chip Model theory, double-barreling.\n- **Profit**: +$560\n\n![wallet](http://i.imgur.com/w8Nt2xl.jpg)\n\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\n$560 from today, $265 from last week, to the point the wallet can't hold itself\nclosed.\n</span></div>\n","slug":"042_poker3","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-24T10:25:46.000Z","_id":"cj4b2m155003cgyi70ioq4qhb","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","content":"<p>I spent another Saturday playing two 30-man $300 guaranteed turbo freerolls at\nthe <a href=\"http://pokerportland.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Final Table Poker Club</a>.

But looks\nlike one of them went on to take the $1.5k first-place prize.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5pm-Freeroll-2-The-Great-Chicago-Fire\"><a href=\"#5pm-Freeroll-2-The-Great-Chicago-Fire\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"5pm Freeroll #2 - The Great Chicago Fire\"></a>5pm Freeroll #2 - The Great Chicago Fire</h3><p>My stack was a healthy average, my M-ratio was still about 8, so I had a little\nroom for flop play. I had Q7o on the button and raised 2.5x (4k) for a steal.\nThe small-blind, an old weak-tight player (not sure if he was all there)\ncalled.  The board came 269 two-tone. He checked, and I made a continuation\n(half-pot 4k). He floated so I elected to shut it down after a quick thought\nabout barrelling the paired turn. I checked back. The river gave me a pair of\n7s, and I checked for showdown value to take it down.</p>\n<p>Eventually, we made it five-way. Chicago refused to pay the bubble,\nback-to-back messy bubble negotations. I kept a healthy stack, shoving and\nstealing once in a while to become chip leader. Chicago double-busted two\nplayers for turn it three-way, the other guy being a normal guy in a cap,\ndidn’t have much reads on him, but he wasn’t a total fish. Let’s call him Joe.</p>\n<p>I bullied a bit being the big stack. I shoved KTo on the button, getting\nChicago to call with his Q6o. He caught up on the river, and again yelled:</p>\n<p><em>“I am the 52-card player! And again, I am still. In. The hizz-ouse!”.</em></p>\n<p>Chicago pushed later. I flat-called his raise getting it in ahead, but Joe\nsadly folded, despite to me winking to him that we could check it down to bust\nhim. Unfortunately, a couple hands later, he sucked out on me on the river\nagain:</p>\n<p><em>“I am the 52-card player! And again, I am still. In. The hizz-ouse!”.</em></p>\n<p>Making me the short-stack at ~40k chips out of a total of ~235k chips when\nI earlier had ~120k chips. But I stayed mentally stable, unfazed, silent.\nAs short-stack, I began to play aggressively. Each steal would increase my\nstack 50%. I shoved about 4 times, all being successful steals. Including\nopen shoves on the button, and shoving over a small blind limp.</p>\n<p>I made a small double-up against Joe with a 88 over AQo flip.</p>\n<p>I picked up A9o on the button and raised to 2.5x. The other guy, smartly folded\nwith only 2 big blinds left from the small blind, letting us two big stacks\ntake each other out. Chicago called from the big blind. I had him covered at\nthis point. The flop came Axx, and he donk-shoved all-in, where I immediately\nsnap-called. Aces held. I mocked to myself:</p>\n<p><em>“I have 53 cards, and I have 43 hizz-ouses or something…”</em></p>\n<p>Chicago was busted.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5pm-Freeroll-2-Taking-It-Home\"><a href=\"#5pm-Freeroll-2-Taking-It-Home\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"5pm Freeroll #2 - Taking It Home\"></a>5pm Freeroll #2 - Taking It Home</h3><p>It was heads-up against Joe and me. He was proud making that smart laydown\nto bump up the pay structure with only 2 big blinds, a decision that netted him\nan extra $35. He had less than 2 big blinds at this point. The match was\nalready decided, and we both knew it. The rest was a formality.</p>\n<p>He won the first flip.</p>\n<p>I shoved AJs and he had no choice but to call with Q8o. Board rolled, KTxx.\nHe wished to the poker gods:</p>\n<p><em>“give me a Q, give me a Q”</em></p>\n<p>And the river came a Q. He looked initially happy before I pointed out I rolled\nout a straight. We both chuckled, and went to cash out, happy that we made it\nover Chicago. I went home with my back-to-back first place finishes. I play\nagain Friday.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/lTNZLBI.jpg\" alt=\"firstplace2\"></p>\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nResults of the 5pm freeroll.\n</span></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"Session-Conclusion\"><a href=\"#Session-Conclusion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Session Conclusion\"></a>Session Conclusion</h2><ul>\n<li><strong>Went Well</strong>: folding ATo in the small blind instead of stealing<pre><code>because the guy was confidently stacking his chips.\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><strong>Mistakes</strong>: successful and frequent shove-steals during the bubble to build<pre><code>stack.\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><strong>Get Better At</strong>: Independent Chip Model theory, double-barreling.</li>\n<li><strong>Profit</strong>: +$560</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/w8Nt2xl.jpg\" alt=\"wallet\"></p>\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\n$560 from today, $265 from last week, to the point the wallet can’t hold itself\nclosed.\n</span></div>\n"},{"title":"Poker Session #4 - My First Tourney Bust, Cash Game Redemption","type":"blog","date":"2014-01-31T08:00:00.000Z","id":"poker4","image":{"url":"http://i.imgur.com/r9TCVBK.jpg"},"_content":"\nI went out with my visiting coworker from MN this Friday night to play some\npoker at the [Encore](http://www.encoreclub.com). With $50, we both signed up\nfor the 100-man $10000 tourney. After several hours we both busted, him right\non the bubble and me around the 40-player mark. Though like any other donk, I\nmade my way to the $1/$2 cash games at midnight after busting. I had an awesome\ntime with the loose and free-flowing table talk at late night cash game. There\nI took back $290. Although I suffered my first ever live tournament bust (after\n5 cashes in a row including 3 high-money finishes), the run-good continues from\n[Poker Session #3](/blog/poker3).\n\n---\n\n## $6000 Guaranteed - Bust at 40th\n\nAfter the Mozilla Marketplace work week in Portland, we finally go out for some\ncards. A short-haired guy about my age sat down directly to my right, just\nhaving stood from a cash game. Let's call him Z. The table is crickets, but Z\ntries to up the conversation. He seems pretty chill so I end up talking to him\na bit. Well, maybe a lot. We got pretty friendly. I got into a hand with him\nsoon after.\n\n    UTG+2: x\n    MP1:x\n    MP2: x\n    CO: x\n    BTN: x\n    SB: x\n    BB: x\n    UTG: $10000.00\n    Hero (UTG+1): $15000.00\n\n    Pre Flop: ($150.00) Hero is UTG+1 with As Kd\n    UTG raises to $300, Hero raises to $900, 7 folds, UTG calls $900\n\n    Flop: ($1950.00) 7s 5s 2s (2 players)\n    UTG checks, Hero bets $1200, UTG raises to $3200, Hero calls $3200\n\n    Turn: ($8350.00) Ts (2 players)\n    UTG bets $4000, Hero calls $4000\n\n    River: ($16350.00) Kc (2 players)\n    UTG checks, Hero checks\n\n    UTG shows 7c7h\n    Hero shows AdKs\n    Hero wins $16350.00.\n\nEarly in the tournament. No reads. Z raises UTG, and I'm dealt AxKs. I 3bet,\neveryone folds and Z calls. The board comes 7xx, all spades. Z check-raises\nme 2.5x. It's scary, but I have a draw to the second nut flush and two overs so\nI call. The turn comes a spade, completing the flush. Z bets the turn,\npot-committing himself. I tank. I thought Z could have AQ+ with a spade, maybe\nAA with a spade though unlikely. We check down the river and he shows 77 for a\nset. I actually didn't put him on that for calling a 3bet out of position and\nbetting the four-flush board. I think I could shove the turn, but we're both\nstill friendly afterwards.\n\nMore hands pass. I steal a bit, value bit top pair some, etc. Keeping an above\naverage stack through two breaks. Then I run into a difficult hand.\n\n    UTG: x\n    UTG+1: x\n    UTG+2: x\n    Hero (MP1): $40000.00\n    MP2: x\n    CO: x\n    BTN: A lot of chips\n    SB: x\n    BB: x\n\n    Pre Flop: ($3400.00) Hero is MP1 with 5s 5c\n    Hero raises to $4500, 2 folds, BTN calls $4500, 2 folds\n\n    Flop: ($12400.00) Ts 7s 2c (2 players)\n    Hero bets $7000, BTN calls $7000\n\n    Turn: ($26400.00) Ah (2 players)\n    Hero $10000, BTN calls $10000\n\n    River: ($46400.00) 5d (2 players)\n    Hero checks, BTN all-in, Hero folds\n\nBTN is an Asian TAG in a hoodie. Let's call him Panda. I just saw Panda call a\n3bet out out position with 77 and double up with slowplayed flopped quads. I\nhad just stolen 3 pots in a row with good holdings. Panda defends the button.\nThe flop is decent to cbet so I bet just over half pot. Panda floats.  Here was\na mistake, I didn't think too much about what he had. The turn comes an Ah, a\nperfect barrel card, so I double-barrel with half my stack. He calls. Whoops.\n\nAfter preflop, I guess he could have {78s+, AT+, KQ+, 66-TT}. When he calls\nthe flop, his range is {89, AT+, 77-TT} where he would float with two overs\nand an Ace. My mistake was barreling the turn. Although it's a scare card,\nhe continues with almost all range {89, AT+, 77, TT}.\n\nSo after this hand, I lose half my stack, and pretty much get killed by the\nblinds and antes. Final showdown running my AQ into AK pre. And after 5-6\nhours, my first ever tournament bust after running good for 5 tourneys in a\nrow. Oh well, you can't win them all. My coworker witnessed my bust and had a\nreally good stack behind him, although busting one place out of the money. Not\nwanting to go home yet at midnight with nothing to do, I signed up for the cash\ngames.\n\n## Cash Game - +$290\n\nLately, I've been playing tourneys, but I used to be an online cash player. Now\nin Portland, it isn't *technically* a cash game, those would actually be illegal\nsince gambling laws dictate one must not bet more than $1 in any event. All\nclubs get around this by having a \"tournament\" called a \"shootout\".  In\ntraditional shootouts, players play until one man is left standing. Players buy\n(or \"rent\") tournament chips which have no inherit cash value. They give the\nshootout a time limit (2 hours), and at the end they do an equity chop,\neveryone walking away with what they have on the table. There are unlimited\nrebuys and players can sit at any time, but just not leave. tl;dr it's a cash\ngame.\n\nEncore runs $1/$2 cash games so I bought in for a full $200. I sit, again,\ndirectly to the left of Z, giving me position on him. Which is pretty good, I\nhave some reads on him. We start chatting a lot again. The game starts.\n\nI take down the first two pots with some isolating + cbetting with good hands.\nThen I pick up a healthy pot.\n\n    Pre Flop: ($3.00) Hero is UTG+1 with As Ac\n    UTG calls. Hero raises to $6, MP1 calls, CO folds, BTN calls, SB folds, BB folds, UTG calls\n\n    Flop: ($36.00) Td Jh Kh (5 players)\n    UTG checks. Hero bets $15, MP1 calls. BTN calls. BB folds. UTG folds.\n\n    Turn: ($81.00) 7s (3 players)\n    Hero bets $50, MP1 raises $112 (all in), BTN folds, Hero calls\n\n    Hero shows As Ac\n    MP1 shows Qd 9s\n\n    River: ($325.00) 8c (2 players)\n\n    Hero wins $325.00\n\nI pick up AA so I make a 3x raise. Unfortunately, I pick up the whole table\nalong for the ride. The flop is scary. Lots of people could call with\ntwo high cards, but I figure I'm decent to be good and there's some draws\non the board I want to avoid. I cbet and get a couple callers. The\nturn is a blank, but I bet out, planning to fold to a raise. Then someone\nraises all in for only a bit more than a min-raise. I look at the board\nand with all the draws out there, I couldn't fold. Plus I had a gutshot.  I\ncall. He says I got it and flips over an open-ended straight draw. My pair\nholds to collect a big pot. Hey, why waste hours playing a tournament when I\ncan just win one big cash game hand?\n\nZ and I are talking the whole session. Turns out he went to Oregon State\nUniversity at the same time as I did. We were even in the same physics class at\none point. He talks a bit about the Corvallis home games which sound fun. Well,\nhe gets a bit drunk. The table gets a bit loose and rowdy. A guy was angle-shooting\nby motioning to be folding out-of-turn, and the dealer (a blonde girl, let's\ncall her Kay) tried to warn him, but the guy was too drunk to comply. The floor\nwas eventually called. He stayed, but he drunkenly tilted off three stacks (one\nto me earlier with the aces). That led to good table conversation about drunken\njerks.\n\nThe dealer talks about her love life a bit, \"casually\" dating multiple people,\nhow one of her dates told her he wanted to suck on her earlobes or something. She\nwas blushing a bit as the table erupted with laughter and jokes. She was a nice\nand funny dealer allowing the table to prod at her a little.\n\nI stack another guy with my KK vs 99 all in preflop for about $70.\n\nEveryone drinks Fireball double shots. People get tipsy. Z is glowing red and\nwobbling. I saw him spill a bit of beer earlier because he forgot he was just\ngiven a full glass of beer. His friend joked he always spills his full beers.\nSo I'm always physically motioning backing off whenever he reaches for his\nbeer. Unlike the earlier drunken jerk, he was a drunken friendly. Dealer\nthought it was cute. He kind of reminded me of Tracey from Firefly.\n\nHis friend sat at one point to Z's right. My coworker had given me a read on\nhim that he was weak, easy to bluff. Well, Z's friend and I get into an\ninteresting hand.\n\n    Pre Flop: ($3.00) Hero is BTN with Js Jc\n    UTG straddles $4. 2 folds. MP raises $16, CO folds, Hero calls $16, 3 folds\n\n    Flop: ($39.00) Td 5c 2s (2 players)\n    MP bets $25. Hero raises $50, UTG folds.\n\n    Hero wins $89\n\nI actually consider my folding my Jacks preflop after the big raise, but I\nfound out there was a straddle (blind raise) which possibly meant Z's friend\nwas just attacking the straddle. So after some tanking and saying *\"ugh why do\nyou have to do this to me, I really want to call with this\"*, I decide to call.\nHeads-up to the flop.  Z's friend bets, and I'm a bit nervous. I min-raise for\nsome \"information\" and as a bluff since my coworker gave me a read that he was\nweak. I actually announce *\"raise, minimum\"*. He tanks for a bit, putting me on\na set due to the way I acted preflop seeming like I had a small pocket pair. He\nfolds. I give him some friendly info I had an overpair, as did he (probably\nQQ).\n\nZ is doing pretty well with $550 in front by bluffing a guy across the table (Z\ntold me he would and Z shows me all his cards afterwards), and then soon\nafterwards valuetowning the same guy. I suggest to him that we shouldn't tangle\ndue to our large stacks, and he jokes that *\"yeah, it's an unwritten rule, you\nraise big and I respect. I raise big and you, you know, respect it too\".* Which\nsounded an awful lots like collusion through soft-playing! But I'll take it.\n\nI go on auto-fold for like 45 minutes until the shootout ends to lock down my\nearnings. I opt-out of the Five Dolla Holla ($5 table lottery) and tip the\ndealer. I end up with $495 in front for $295 in profit for the cash game.\n\n## Session Conclusion:\n\n- **Went Well**: flop min-raise with the read\n- **Mistakes**: double barrel without hand reading\n- **Get Better At**: applying hand reading\n- **Profit**: +$215\n","source":"_posts/043_poker4.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"Poker Session #4 - My First Tourney Bust, Cash Game Redemption\"\ntype: blog\ncategory: blog\ndate: 2014-01-31\nid: poker4\ntags: poker\n\nimage:\n    url: http://i.imgur.com/r9TCVBK.jpg\n---\n\nI went out with my visiting coworker from MN this Friday night to play some\npoker at the [Encore](http://www.encoreclub.com).

He tanks for a bit, putting me on\na set due to the way I acted preflop seeming like I had a small pocket pair. He\nfolds. I give him some friendly info I had an overpair, as did he (probably\nQQ).\n\nZ is doing pretty well with $550 in front by bluffing a guy across the table (Z\ntold me he would and Z shows me all his cards afterwards), and then soon\nafterwards valuetowning the same guy. I suggest to him that we shouldn't tangle\ndue to our large stacks, and he jokes that *\"yeah, it's an unwritten rule, you\nraise big and I respect. I raise big and you, you know, respect it too\".* Which\nsounded an awful lots like collusion through soft-playing! But I'll take it.\n\nI go on auto-fold for like 45 minutes until the shootout ends to lock down my\nearnings. I opt-out of the Five Dolla Holla ($5 table lottery) and tip the\ndealer. I end up with $495 in front for $295 in profit for the cash game.\n\n## Session Conclusion:\n\n- **Went Well**: flop min-raise with the read\n- **Mistakes**: double barrel without hand reading\n- **Get Better At**: applying hand reading\n- **Profit**: +$215\n","slug":"043_poker4","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-24T10:25:46.000Z","_id":"cj4b2m156003egyi7tj3u795n","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","content":"<p>I went out with my visiting coworker from MN this Friday night to play some\npoker at the <a href=\"http://www.encoreclub.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Encore</a>.

A short-haired guy about my age sat down directly to my right, just\nhaving stood from a cash game. Let’s call him Z. The table is crickets, but Z\ntries to up the conversation. He seems pretty chill so I end up talking to him\na bit. Well, maybe a lot. We got pretty friendly. I got into a hand with him\nsoon after.</p>\n<pre><code>UTG+2: x\nMP1:x\nMP2: x\nCO: x\nBTN: x\nSB: x\nBB: x\nUTG: $10000.00\nHero (UTG+1): $15000.00\n\nPre Flop: ($150.00) Hero is UTG+1 with As Kd\nUTG raises to $300, Hero raises to $900, 7 folds, UTG calls $900\n\nFlop: ($1950.00) 7s 5s 2s (2 players)\nUTG checks, Hero bets $1200, UTG raises to $3200, Hero calls $3200\n\nTurn: ($8350.00) Ts (2 players)\nUTG bets $4000, Hero calls $4000\n\nRiver: ($16350.00) Kc (2 players)\nUTG checks, Hero checks\n\nUTG shows 7c7h\nHero shows AdKs\nHero wins $16350.00.\n</code></pre><p>Early in the tournament. No reads. Z raises UTG, and I’m dealt AxKs. I 3bet,\neveryone folds and Z calls. The board comes 7xx, all spades. Z check-raises\nme 2.5x. It’s scary, but I have a draw to the second nut flush and two overs so\nI call. The turn comes a spade, completing the flush. Z bets the turn,\npot-committing himself. I tank. I thought Z could have AQ+ with a spade, maybe\nAA with a spade though unlikely. We check down the river and he shows 77 for a\nset. I actually didn’t put him on that for calling a 3bet out of position and\nbetting the four-flush board. I think I could shove the turn, but we’re both\nstill friendly afterwards.</p>\n<p>More hands pass. I steal a bit, value bit top pair some, etc. Keeping an above\naverage stack through two breaks. Then I run into a difficult hand.</p>\n<pre><code>UTG: x\nUTG+1: x\nUTG+2: x\nHero (MP1): $40000.00\nMP2: x\nCO: x\nBTN: A lot of chips\nSB: x\nBB: x\n\nPre Flop: ($3400.00) Hero is MP1 with 5s 5c\nHero raises to $4500, 2 folds, BTN calls $4500, 2 folds\n\nFlop: ($12400.00) Ts 7s 2c (2 players)\nHero bets $7000, BTN calls $7000\n\nTurn: ($26400.00) Ah (2 players)\nHero $10000, BTN calls $10000\n\nRiver: ($46400.00) 5d (2 players)\nHero checks, BTN all-in, Hero folds\n</code></pre><p>BTN is an Asian TAG in a hoodie. Let’s call him Panda. I just saw Panda call a\n3bet out out position with 77 and double up with slowplayed flopped quads. I\nhad just stolen 3 pots in a row with good holdings. Panda defends the button.\nThe flop is decent to cbet so I bet just over half pot. Panda floats.  Here was\na mistake, I didn’t think too much about what he had. The turn comes an Ah, a\nperfect barrel card, so I double-barrel with half my stack. He calls. Whoops.</p>\n<p>After preflop, I guess he could have {78s+, AT+, KQ+, 66-TT}. When he calls\nthe flop, his range is {89, AT+, 77-TT} where he would float with two overs\nand an Ace. My mistake was barreling the turn. Although it’s a scare card,\nhe continues with almost all range {89, AT+, 77, TT}.</p>\n<p>So after this hand, I lose half my stack, and pretty much get killed by the\nblinds and antes. Final showdown running my AQ into AK pre. And after 5-6\nhours, my first ever tournament bust after running good for 5 tourneys in a\nrow. Oh well, you can’t win them all. My coworker witnessed my bust and had a\nreally good stack behind him, although busting one place out of the money. Not\nwanting to go home yet at midnight with nothing to do, I signed up for the cash\ngames.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Cash-Game-290\"><a href=\"#Cash-Game-290\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Cash Game - +$290\"></a>Cash Game - +$290</h2><p>Lately, I’ve been playing tourneys, but I used to be an online cash player. Now\nin Portland, it isn’t <em>technically</em> a cash game, those would actually be illegal\nsince gambling laws dictate one must not bet more than $1 in any event. All\nclubs get around this by having a “tournament” called a “shootout”.  In\ntraditional shootouts, players play until one man is left standing. Players buy\n(or “rent”) tournament chips which have no inherit cash value. They give the\nshootout a time limit (2 hours), and at the end they do an equity chop,\neveryone walking away with what they have on the table. There are unlimited\nrebuys and players can sit at any time, but just not leave. tl;dr it’s a cash\ngame.</p>\n<p>Encore runs $1/$2 cash games so I bought in for a full $200. I sit, again,\ndirectly to the left of Z, giving me position on him. Which is pretty good, I\nhave some reads on him. We start chatting a lot again. The game starts.</p>\n<p>I take down the first two pots with some isolating + cbetting with good hands.\nThen I pick up a healthy pot.</p>\n<pre><code>Pre Flop: ($3.00) Hero is UTG+1 with As Ac\nUTG calls.

Unfortunately, I pick up the whole table\nalong for the ride. The flop is scary. Lots of people could call with\ntwo high cards, but I figure I’m decent to be good and there’s some draws\non the board I want to avoid. I cbet and get a couple callers. The\nturn is a blank, but I bet out, planning to fold to a raise. Then someone\nraises all in for only a bit more than a min-raise. I look at the board\nand with all the draws out there, I couldn’t fold. Plus I had a gutshot.  I\ncall. He says I got it and flips over an open-ended straight draw. My pair\nholds to collect a big pot. Hey, why waste hours playing a tournament when I\ncan just win one big cash game hand?</p>\n<p>Z and I are talking the whole session. Turns out he went to Oregon State\nUniversity at the same time as I did. We were even in the same physics class at\none point. He talks a bit about the Corvallis home games which sound fun. Well,\nhe gets a bit drunk. The table gets a bit loose and rowdy. A guy was angle-shooting\nby motioning to be folding out-of-turn, and the dealer (a blonde girl, let’s\ncall her Kay) tried to warn him, but the guy was too drunk to comply. The floor\nwas eventually called. He stayed, but he drunkenly tilted off three stacks (one\nto me earlier with the aces). That led to good table conversation about drunken\njerks.</p>\n<p>The dealer talks about her love life a bit, “casually” dating multiple people,\nhow one of her dates told her he wanted to suck on her earlobes or something. She\nwas blushing a bit as the table erupted with laughter and jokes. She was a nice\nand funny dealer allowing the table to prod at her a little.</p>\n<p>I stack another guy with my KK vs 99 all in preflop for about $70.</p>\n<p>Everyone drinks Fireball double shots. People get tipsy. Z is glowing red and\nwobbling. I saw him spill a bit of beer earlier because he forgot he was just\ngiven a full glass of beer. His friend joked he always spills his full beers.\nSo I’m always physically motioning backing off whenever he reaches for his\nbeer. Unlike the earlier drunken jerk, he was a drunken friendly. Dealer\nthought it was cute. He kind of reminded me of Tracey from Firefly.</p>\n<p>His friend sat at one point to Z’s right. My coworker had given me a read on\nhim that he was weak, easy to bluff. Well, Z’s friend and I get into an\ninteresting hand.</p>\n<pre><code>Pre Flop: ($3.00) Hero is BTN with Js Jc\nUTG straddles $4. 2 folds.

I spent the week throwing\nback to the old poker days, lurking the 2+2 forums, picking up the Harrington\non Hold'em books, and listening to poker podcasts during my 5-minute commute\nand work-outs. My blog now even features its own [poker\nsection](/blog/tags/poker) after bouncing back in forth between migrating it to\n[Octopress](http://octopress.org) and then standing pat with\n[Wok](http://wok.mythmon.com). Wok suits me better with less boilerplate, a\nbetter templating engine, and more support for non-blog pages. Anyways, after a\nfew monkey-patches with Wok and a custom virutalenv, I'm ready to write some\npoker.\n\nI played two MTTs, a 70-man freeroll and a 30-man $500-guaranteed. Made it to\nthe final tables in both, and cashed in both with a 9th place finish in the\nfreeroll for $45 and a 2nd place finish in the $500-guaranteed for $265.  Last\nsession, I cashed in 5th at the $500-guaranteed for $80. So things are rolling well.\nWhether I'm running hot, or I'm playing solid, only sample size will tell.\n\n---\n\n## Freeroll - 9th Place for $45\n\nI was actually a bit sick, developing a small cough, when I played the day, but\nnothing too bad. The field was large at 70 people. I played tight in the early\nblind rounds, gaining a large lead on my table. My first big pot involved a\nflush over flush.  We both hit our flushes on the turn, mine bigger. He bet, I\nraised, and we eventually got it all in. He lost with his 9-high to my T-high\nflush. He said he was value-raising possibly against the straight on the board,\nbut I told him I wouldn't raise a straight so aggressively on a flush board.\n\nI held 88 and raised preflop and got heads-up with an old guy. My read on him\nwas that he liked to chase draws hard. I flopped a set, but on a two-tone board.\nSeeing the draws out there, I elected not to slow-play and bet around 3/4 pot. He\nflatted. I put him on the draw and my set was pretty much the nuts. He lead out on\nthe turn where I shoved. He correctly folded, knowing he didn't have the odds\nto peel off one more to the flush.\n\nAt the break, I took the add-on to give me a larger stack.\n\n### Freeroll - The Silent Assassin\n\nAfter a while, a older guy wearing a beret noticed me at the table with a large\nstack. Though I gained them pretty quietly. He coined me *the Silent Assassin*\nsince I rarely talk at the table yet I was stacking people. One day, I would be\non a TV table at the World Poker Tour where the commentators would refer to me\nas the Assassin. I thought that was amusing, I don't have any other poker\nnickname, so I'll take it.\n\nIn a 4-way pot, I held Js2s on the big blind. The table limped around to me, and\nI checked going to a 4-way pot. I flopped a spade flush. Being 4-way, I figured\nsomeone was holding a Ks or As. I potted. The UTG, who limped, raised. Everyone\nelse folded. I didn't want any more cards to peel, so I 4-bet 3x here and\nsnap-called the shove. He showed AsAx, overpair with a draw to the nut flush.\nA bit of a cooler for him, that's a good hand to get it in with, but my hand\nheld to take the pot.\n\nMy stack decreased in relative size, however as the blinds raised. Before long,\nI was a relatively short stack. I shoved with A4o on the button and was called\nby JTo. A coin-flip, but I held up on the river. I talked to him later, grudging\nme for busting him out, but I didn't recognize him later.\n\n### Freeroll - Busting the Final Table\n\nMy stint at the final table was short-lived. I had a short to medium stack.\nI picked up AQo on the button and accidentally min-raised, not knowing about\nthe recent increase in blinds. The small blind, a reg wearing a poker beanie\nwith large black disk earrings, 3-bet with 88, and I 4-bet shoved. I lost the\nflip when he hit a set on the turn. He mentioned 88 was his favorite hand, and\nhe only 3-bet because I min-raised, putting me on a small pocket pair. If I had\nmade a 3x pre-flop raise, he would have flatted, and I could have c-bet to take\ndown the flop. Bummer.\n\nHand before the break, I receive KQo on the small blind. The reg from earlier\nraised from UTG. I thought for a while about shoving, but thought his UTG range\nwas too strong. He showed JJ, which would have been the best I could've hoped\nfor. I said I had two overs. A reg on my left knew it was KQ. He said that\nwould've been good to shove, but I knew at best his early position raise range\nhad me dominated.\n\nLater I receive 88 on the button. I raise 3x, and get 3-bet again by the same\nreg. I 4-bet shove, and he calls with AQo. A mirror situation from earlier.\nUnfortunately, he gets the good side of the coin both times when he hits a J\nfor the straight, and I bust for min-cash.\n\n## $500 Guaranteed - 2nd for $220\n\nAfter not eating all day by 4pm, I ordered some chicken strips before the\ntourney, and they were delivered after I sat on a small food cart.\n\nMy stack wasn't doing to well for this tourney by the break so I didn't add-on,\nnot expecting to cash. I had AKo twice in my first few hands, but my c-bets\nfailed to lose a portion of my stack. There was a pretty talkative guy to my\nleft who I had a tell on, he would always handle his chips prematurely as he\nwas getting ready for a raise. Sometimes I would start to raise, look over, and\nsimply check or call.\n\nI earned the award for the Table Rebalance Donkey, as I was moved to a\ndifferent table five times over the course of the tourney, having to move my\nfood cart along with me.\n\nI focused on reading the guy on my right, a black guy with a spiked baseball\ncap, sunglasses, and a golden watch (call him \"Spikes\"). I got pretty\nshort-stacked, paying close attention to my tournament M-ratio, the ratio of my\nstack to the total blinds per round. Once it dropped below 6, it was pretty\nmuch shove-or-fold. I was in the big blind with K9o and 4 players limped around\nto me. I shoved to pick up the dead money. Everyone folded, but Spikes thought\nfor a long while, perhaps with a small pocket pair or weak broadways. I stared\nat the felt hoping for the fold, and after nearly calling, he mucked, and my\nstack was back to the Orange Zone.\n\nI got into a hand with Spikes a couple minutes later, where I picked up AA in\nmiddle position. Spikes raised pre-flop, and I shoved on him again. I could\nhave raised small, but I know that he just saw me shove and he almost called.\nI figured he wouldn't take that twice in a row. So it folded around and he\ncalled with 77. My aces held to double up.\n\nOnce it got down to 4-handed, we agreed to pay the bubble. Then it got down to\n3: me, Spikes, and a talkative maybe-reg with glasses who reminded me of Amir\nfrom CollegeHumor. I quickly stack him with QQ over AQo all-in pre-flop. And\nI go heads-up with Spikes.\n\n### $500 Guaranteed - Heads-Up\n\nI'm not particularly great at heads-up, but I thought I could outplay Spikes.\nWe went back and forth a lot. The dynamic was he would shove very, very often,\nand while I was aggressive pre-flop and on the flop, I didn't have it to call.\nI doubled up on the flop, with JTs, hitting my open-ended straight on the turn.\n\nThe final was me on the button, raising with K6s. He shoves. He had me covered,\nand I think K6s is good enough to get it in with someone shoving so light. He\nflips 34o; I had it dominated with two overs (4:1 in my favor). Unfortunately,\nhe hits a 4 on the river to end the tourney. Well, you win some, you lose some,\nI was happy to get it ahead and get some heads-up experience. I tipped the\ndealer $20.\n\nI stayed at the club a few more hours to watch the Blazers game and work on the\nfailed Octopress blog migration. I maybe should have played the $8000 guaranteed\nconsidering the club was pitching in $3000, but I was satisfied with taking\nhome $265. I'll go again in a couple of weeks after I get back from Corvallis.\nI found out one of my co-workers is a poker player too, with a pretty juicy\nbackground, so I'll play with him at the club once he flies over to Portland\nfor our team work-week.\n\n+$190\n","source":"_posts/039_poker2.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"Poker Session #2 - 663% ROI\"\ntype: blog\ncategory: blog\ndate: 2014-01-15\nid: \"poker2\"\ntags: poker\n\nimage:\n    url: http://i.imgur.com/WVuj6xb.jpg\n    where: top\n---\n\nAn all-day Saturday session at the Encore Poker club.

Anyways, after a\nfew monkey-patches with Wok and a custom virutalenv, I'm ready to write some\npoker.\n\nI played two MTTs, a 70-man freeroll and a 30-man $500-guaranteed.

The field was large at 70 people. I played tight in the early\nblind rounds, gaining a large lead on my table. My first big pot involved a\nflush over flush.  We both hit our flushes on the turn, mine bigger. He bet, I\nraised, and we eventually got it all in. He lost with his 9-high to my T-high\nflush.

He correctly folded, knowing he didn’t have the odds\nto peel off one more to the flush.</p>\n<p>At the break, I took the add-on to give me a larger stack.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Freeroll-The-Silent-Assassin\"><a href=\"#Freeroll-The-Silent-Assassin\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Freeroll - The Silent Assassin\"></a>Freeroll - The Silent Assassin</h3><p>After a while, a older guy wearing a beret noticed me at the table with a large\nstack. Though I gained them pretty quietly. He coined me <em>the Silent Assassin</em>\nsince I rarely talk at the table yet I was stacking people. One day, I would be\non a TV table at the World Poker Tour where the commentators would refer to me\nas the Assassin. I thought that was amusing, I don’t have any other poker\nnickname, so I’ll take it.</p>\n<p>In a 4-way pot, I held Js2s on the big blind. The table limped around to me, and\nI checked going to a 4-way pot. I flopped a spade flush. Being 4-way, I figured\nsomeone was holding a Ks or As. I potted. The UTG, who limped, raised. Everyone\nelse folded. I didn’t want any more cards to peel, so I 4-bet 3x here and\nsnap-called the shove. He showed AsAx, overpair with a draw to the nut flush.\nA bit of a cooler for him, that’s a good hand to get it in with, but my hand\nheld to take the pot.</p>\n<p>My stack decreased in relative size, however as the blinds raised. Before long,\nI was a relatively short stack. I shoved with A4o on the button and was called\nby JTo. A coin-flip, but I held up on the river. I talked to him later, grudging\nme for busting him out, but I didn’t recognize him later.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Freeroll-Busting-the-Final-Table\"><a href=\"#Freeroll-Busting-the-Final-Table\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Freeroll - Busting the Final Table\"></a>Freeroll - Busting the Final Table</h3><p>My stint at the final table was short-lived. I had a short to medium stack.\nI picked up AQo on the button and accidentally min-raised, not knowing about\nthe recent increase in blinds. The small blind, a reg wearing a poker beanie\nwith large black disk earrings, 3-bet with 88, and I 4-bet shoved. I lost the\nflip when he hit a set on the turn. He mentioned 88 was his favorite hand, and\nhe only 3-bet because I min-raised, putting me on a small pocket pair. If I had\nmade a 3x pre-flop raise, he would have flatted, and I could have c-bet to take\ndown the flop. Bummer.</p>\n<p>Hand before the break, I receive KQo on the small blind. The reg from earlier\nraised from UTG. I thought for a while about shoving, but thought his UTG range\nwas too strong. He showed JJ, which would have been the best I could’ve hoped\nfor. I said I had two overs. A reg on my left knew it was KQ. He said that\nwould’ve been good to shove, but I knew at best his early position raise range\nhad me dominated.</p>\n<p>Later I receive 88 on the button. I raise 3x, and get 3-bet again by the same\nreg. I 4-bet shove, and he calls with AQo. A mirror situation from earlier.\nUnfortunately, he gets the good side of the coin both times when he hits a J\nfor the straight, and I bust for min-cash.</p>\n<h2 id=\"500-Guaranteed-2nd-for-220\"><a href=\"#500-Guaranteed-2nd-for-220\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"$500 Guaranteed - 2nd for $220\"></a>$500 Guaranteed - 2nd for $220</h2><p>After not eating all day by 4pm, I ordered some chicken strips before the\ntourney, and they were delivered after I sat on a small food cart.</p>\n<p>My stack wasn’t doing to well for this tourney by the break so I didn’t add-on,\nnot expecting to cash. I had AKo twice in my first few hands, but my c-bets\nfailed to lose a portion of my stack. There was a pretty talkative guy to my\nleft who I had a tell on, he would always handle his chips prematurely as he\nwas getting ready for a raise. Sometimes I would start to raise, look over, and\nsimply check or call.</p>\n<p>I earned the award for the Table Rebalance Donkey, as I was moved to a\ndifferent table five times over the course of the tourney, having to move my\nfood cart along with me.</p>\n<p>I focused on reading the guy on my right, a black guy with a spiked baseball\ncap, sunglasses, and a golden watch (call him “Spikes”). I got pretty\nshort-stacked, paying close attention to my tournament M-ratio, the ratio of my\nstack to the total blinds per round. Once it dropped below 6, it was pretty\nmuch shove-or-fold. I was in the big blind with K9o and 4 players limped around\nto me. I shoved to pick up the dead money. Everyone folded, but Spikes thought\nfor a long while, perhaps with a small pocket pair or weak broadways. I stared\nat the felt hoping for the fold, and after nearly calling, he mucked, and my\nstack was back to the Orange Zone.</p>\n<p>I got into a hand with Spikes a couple minutes later, where I picked up AA in\nmiddle position. Spikes raised pre-flop, and I shoved on him again. I could\nhave raised small, but I know that he just saw me shove and he almost called.\nI figured he wouldn’t take that twice in a row. So it folded around and he\ncalled with 77. My aces held to double up.</p>\n<p>Once it got down to 4-handed, we agreed to pay the bubble. Then it got down to\n3: me, Spikes, and a talkative maybe-reg with glasses who reminded me of Amir\nfrom CollegeHumor. I quickly stack him with QQ over AQo all-in pre-flop. And\nI go heads-up with Spikes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"500-Guaranteed-Heads-Up\"><a href=\"#500-Guaranteed-Heads-Up\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"$500 Guaranteed - Heads-Up\"></a>$500 Guaranteed - Heads-Up</h3><p>I’m not particularly great at heads-up, but I thought I could outplay Spikes.\nWe went back and forth a lot. The dynamic was he would shove very, very often,\nand while I was aggressive pre-flop and on the flop, I didn’t have it to call.\nI doubled up on the flop, with JTs, hitting my open-ended straight on the turn.</p>\n<p>The final was me on the button, raising with K6s. He shoves. He had me covered,\nand I think K6s is good enough to get it in with someone shoving so light. He\nflips 34o; I had it dominated with two overs (4:1 in my favor). Unfortunately,\nhe hits a 4 on the river to end the tourney. Well, you win some, you lose some,\nI was happy to get it ahead and get some heads-up experience. I tipped the\ndealer $20.</p>\n<p>I stayed at the club a few more hours to watch the Blazers game and work on the\nfailed Octopress blog migration. I maybe should have played the $8000 guaranteed\nconsidering the club was pitching in $3000, but I was satisfied with taking\nhome $265. I’ll go again in a couple of weeks after I get back from Corvallis.\nI found out one of my co-workers is a poker player too, with a pretty juicy\nbackground, so I’ll play with him at the club once he flies over to Portland\nfor our team work-week.</p>\n<p>+$190</p>\n"},{"title":"Poker Session #5 - The Second Coming of the Great Chicago Fire","type":"blog","date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00.000Z","id":"poker5","image":{"url":"http://imgur.com/3FR42kr.jpg"},"_content":"\nAfter playing for 6 hours at the Encore and getting 4 hours of sleep at 5am, I\nget up early to catch the bus across town to play at the [Final\nTable](http://pokerportland.com) on Saturday morning.

I later busted out of an ill-advised $50/$2000 deepstack\ntourney due to drowsiness and mental incapacitation. This is my biggest cash\nthus far and am still reeling Supa Hot Fire from <a href=\"/blog/poker4\">Poker Session #4</a>.</p>\n<p>I am polishing the content of these poker posts, balancing poker strategy with\nanecdotes as to not sound rambling.

It was a long trek to get\n11 miles across town. Luckily, I found a <a href=\"http://car2go.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Car2Go</a> nearby\nand left my apartment to give me just enough time to get to the bus.\nUnfortunately, I had trouble finding it as my phone telling me it was parked in\nthe middle of the city block. I ran around as time ticked and found it was inside\na Safeway parking garage. I sprinted up the levels, stole some poor grocery\nshopper’s Car2Go, and made my way to the bus stop in Old Town Portland. More\ndrama appeared to fluster my day when I received a text that I failed to end my\nCar2Go trip, and I had to spend some of the bus ride with Car2Go customer\nservice.</p>\n<p>But alas, I make it to the Final Table! I busted in the first freeroll, pricing\nmyself with JTo after a preflop raise, continuation bet, and calling an all-in\nwith an open-ended straight draw versus TPTK. Shame, I was at above stack\naverage too but the high blinds made each bet a large chunk of my stack. I lost\njust in time to register for one of their larger tourneys.

The Silent Assassin operates well\non Chicago. Refer to <strong>The Great Chicago Fire</strong> from <a href=\"/blog/poker2\">Poker Session #2</a>\nfor when I single-handedly knocked him out in another\ntournament. He seems to be a regular so he probably didn’t recognize me but\nmaybe if I keep busting him every other Saturday. Anyways midway into the\ntourney, I sit a couple of seats to his left. I know who he was, a loud player\nwith a pretty wide range preflop who loved to gamble (he was pretty lucky too).\nI wouldn’t say he’s a calling station (I got him to fold whenever I wanted),\nbut he very often gets it all in on the flop with a marginal holding only to\ncatch up on the river.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1pm-3000-Guaranteed-Chicago’s-Greatest-Demise-Since-D-Rose\"><a href=\"#1pm-3000-Guaranteed-Chicago’s-Greatest-Demise-Since-D-Rose\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1pm $3000 Guaranteed - Chicago’s Greatest Demise Since D.Rose\"></a>1pm $3000 Guaranteed - Chicago’s Greatest Demise Since D.Rose</h3><p>Anyways, when I sat next to him I was a bit below average stack. The hand before\nthe break. Chicago raised from the button. I 3bet with AJo from the SB. BB calls.\nFlop goes AA9. Blinds check and Chicago bets. We both flat call. Turn puts a flush\ndraw on the board. I check-raise my trips all-in on the turn (for not much\nmore).  BB shoves, Chicago tanks. I didn’t feel too good at this point, feeling\nlike at least one of them had me out-kicked or already boated up. But Chicago\ncalls and flips A6, BB flips a flush draw.

I watched\nhim be aggressive postflop, betting with marginal hands or air. So I adjusted.\nI checked with top pair for deception (risking the draw) in hopes the\naggressive small blind would bet. Unfortunately on the turn, the T puts too\nmany draws out there so I raise. When villain calls, I don't see in getting\nany more value on the river with TPNK.\n\n    Hero (BTN): Healthy stack\n    Villain (BB): Healthy stack\n\n    Pre Flop: Hero is BTN with K4o\n    Hero raises to 3xBB, Villain calls.\n\n    Flop: KQ2r\n    Villain checks, Hero checks.\n\n    Turn: T\n    Villain bets 3/4 pot, Hero raises 3x bet, Villain calls.\n\n    River: 7\n    Villain checks. Hero checks.\n\n    Hero shows K4o\n    SB shows ATo\n\nI played pretty perfectly the whole night, making it to the final table in the\n40-runner tournament.

And when you can't win flips, you lose.\n\n## Session Conclusion\n\n- **Went Well**: punishing the limpers with all-ins from the BB\n- **Mistakes**: attempting a loose iso/steal with 2 limpers with J9s on the button\n                with a yellow stack.

I watched\nhim be aggressive postflop, betting with marginal hands or air. So I adjusted.\nI checked with top pair for deception (risking the draw) in hopes the\naggressive small blind would bet. Unfortunately on the turn, the T puts too\nmany draws out there so I raise. When villain calls, I don't see in getting\nany more value on the river with TPNK.\n\n    Hero (BTN): Healthy stack\n    Villain (BB): Healthy stack\n\n    Pre Flop: Hero is BTN with K4o\n    Hero raises to 3xBB, Villain calls.\n\n    Flop: KQ2r\n    Villain checks, Hero checks.\n\n    Turn: T\n    Villain bets 3/4 pot, Hero raises 3x bet, Villain calls.\n\n    River: 7\n    Villain checks. Hero checks.\n\n    Hero shows K4o\n    SB shows ATo\n\nI played pretty perfectly the whole night, making it to the final table in the\n40-runner tournament. But I only won 1 flip out of 3 (88 vs QK, AK vs AK vs 33,\nA2 vs QK). And when you can't win flips, you lose.\n\n## Session Conclusion\n\n- **Went Well**: punishing the limpers with all-ins from the BB\n- **Mistakes**: attempting a loose iso/steal with 2 limpers with J9s on the button\n                with a yellow stack.

With about 24 players in, I was able to stumble my way into\naround 7th. I made two related blunders over the course of this tourney:\nhandling an all-in with players left to call.\n\nWhen a player goes all-in, and you are holding a hand you want to play (say\nJJ), you want to raise to protect your hand and get it heads-up. In the first\ninstance, player to my right shoves. I hold JJ so I push all-in for deep.\nUnfortunately, SB shows up with KK. Lesson learned, only raise around 2.5x\nfor hand protection leaving me room to play post-flop or fold to a 4bet.\n\nIn the second instance, I was on the button with A9o. A player shoves for 2.5x,\nand I flat. That was a mistake; I either should have protected my hand or\nfolded. The BB called. Another blunder, I expected to check it down. Flop comes\nA9x two-tone for second pair. I should have bet to get the eventual flush draw\npaying, and I shouldn't have paid off a double-barrel on the river for half my\nstack.\n\n## Spirit Mountain Cash Game - -$10\n\nMy girlfriend and I drove to the Spirit Mountain Casino on a Sunday to check it\nout. I played in a $1/$3 game for four hours.\n\nEveryone was really old. Like farmer grandpa old. It was a soft game, limping\neverywhere. I played pretty optimally but got sucked out on one of the early\nhands to make it a session where I lose to the house rake.\n\nI hold TT UTG. I raise 3x, one caller. I lead out the flop.

But whatever, the game was soft and I was\nable to grind back through a card-dead session.\n\nAn old lady asked me how old I was and complimented \"oh, good for you!\".\n\n## Final Table\n\nI spent my holiday (President's Day) at the Final Table, playing three\ntournaments. I got coolered, finished a min-cash, then got double sucked-out.\n\n### 11am Freeroll Guaranteed - Busted\n\nPretty standard up until I got coolered straight over straight. GG.\n\n### 3pm $25 Buy-in Freezeout - 5th Place for $35\n\nMin-cash. Yay. I played standard to the final table where I started getting\naggressive as the blinds raised. Another Vietnamese-American player was pretty\ncool to me and was calling me K-Fed and Young Buck (because I was the youngest\nand everyone was old). I calculated my M-ratio to be 5 so I shoved with 56s in\nthe CO. Someone woke up with KK. GG.\n\n### 5pm $300 Guaranteed Freeroll - Double Busted\n\nI get it in two-pair. Old guy calls my cbet with air. We get it in and he runs\nrunner-runner flush for my stack. Rebuy.\n\nI hold QQ. Someone shoves with JKo, I reshove, same old guy calls with 99. Old\nguy spikes a 9.

With the marvelling\nabundance of wintery nature and wildlife in Alaska, I had to come prepared. So\nI upgraded my camera lens kit, featuring a trio of Pentax Limited Primes.\n\n---\n\n## The Body\n\nI shoot with a **Pentax K-30** due to its superior entry-level bodies and vast\nassortment of cheap legacy lenses. It has a weather-sealed body, dual controls,\na pentaprism viewfinder, same sensor as the D7100, shoots at a good FPS, and\nlotsa buttons. It was tough to end up here, it took weeks of researcn and\nflip-flopping. I previously had a T3i + nifty-fifty last summer which I took to\nChina. I had returned it and then came indecision.\n\nWithin a couple of weeks last August, I had bought and returned/cancelled the\nNikon D3100, D5100, D7100 and the Canon T4i and 60D. At last, I became happy\nwith the Pentax. I've shot thousands of photos with it all over the country,\nand I'm still in love with its handling.\n\n## Hand-Me-Downs\n\nMy dad used to shoot Pentax back in the 80s during the film era. Although\nhe shoots with a Rebel SL1 now, he bestowed upon to me his awesome old gear.\nA Pentax-M 50mm f1.7, a Pentax-A 35mm-105mm, a Sunpak manual flash, a small\nstudio kit (umbrella and slaves). I love most the Pentax-M 50mm f1.7 with its\ndreamy rendering and silky bokeh.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/JooJpqs.jpg)\n\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nPentax-M 50mm f1.7 wide open on some Valentine's Day roses.\n</span></div>\n\n## The Sitch\n\nI currently shoot with the razor-sharp-even-wide-open Tamron 17-50mm f2.8 and\nthe Pentax FA 35mm f2. The Tamron is excellent though I find I take too many\nsubpar photos with it when I travel. Since it's a zoom, I find myself standing\nin one place zooming in and out to compose. The size isn't a big deal but I\nlove walking around with a small surreptitious prime. The 35mm is great when\nI want to go light, and the extra stop comes in handy.\n\n## Upgrade to Limiteds\n\nThough since I'm headed to one of the most beautiful places, I'm gunning for\nmaximum image quality. So I upgraded my whole kit. As a Pentax shooter,\nobviously I had to go for the legendary, although expensive, Pentax Limited\nprimes. Light, all-metal, sharp-as-fuck beauties. Just as I did with my camera\nbodies, I struggled paring it down to just 3 Limiteds. It took me a couple weeks\nand a lot of flip-flopping, but I finally settled on my final trio of primes:\nthe 15/43/70. The Alaska kit:\n\n- **Pentax DA 15mm f4 Limited**: Ultra-wide angle for those landscapes, my\nAurora Borealis killer.\n\n- **Pentax FA 43mm f1.9 Limited**: Widely regarded as one of the best primes of\nall time for any system for its pixie dust. My preferred focal length, a\nlittle wider than a fifty. This will be on my camera walking around.\n\n- **Pentax DA 70mm f2.4 Limited**: For isolation, portraits, and farther\nsubjects.\n\n- **Tamron 17-50mm f2.8**: Super sharp walkaround zoom. Great for travel but\nOnly planning on using it when I don't know exactly what I'm going to\nshoot or when I need a 20-35mm shot.\n\n- **Pentax-M 50mm f1.7**: The standard prime shipped with many kits in the 80s,\nusing this if I want to get creative. Or when I want to shoot a video due to\nits good manual focus throw.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ljFGIif.jpg)\n\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nKit-kat.\n</span></div>\n\nOverall costing about $1.7k. A good use of my poker money. The Limited lenses\nhold their value really well anyways, even having appreciated in value. But\nI'm just trying to justify my recent lens-buying-addiction.

I played two of the\nturbo freeroll tournaments against familiar faces final table play was fucking\namazing during the first tournament but had a couple of hiccups during the\nsecond. I chopped for first place in the first tournament for $220 and finished\nthird in the second tournament for $90. With pressure from my mom and\ngirlfriend, I gave my mom $100 for her to donate to the impoverished in\nVietnam. Thus I nick myself today as Robin Hood, taking from the fish and\ngiving to the poor.\n\n---\n\n## 11am Freeroll - Three-Way Chop for $220\n\nLet's just skip to the final table where I just had my way over everyone\nespecially during the bububble. I recognized my M-ratio and took advantage of\nall of my favorable first-in vigorish situations to pick up dead chips. As\nalways, I love punishing limpers from the blinds with shoves. Fish never\nrecognize how wide you're shoving. After a while, I accumulated a large stack.\nA note to myself, that female-Scotty-Nguyen-wannabe is a huge aggrodonk.\n\nUnfortunately, my KK got cracked in a three-way pot against 44 vs JJ where a\nreg spiked a 4. I built it back up but this hand was actually somewhat\nbeneficial since it was the first hand I showed down after shoving a lot.\nPeople gave me even more credit later. Every time I shoved with face-rag,\nI showed the face and got tons of respect. For instance, I shoved with K3o,\nshowed the K, and got put on KK/KQ.\n\nThe reg who spiked a 4 built up a decent stack. He was a cool guy who\ncomplimented my game and shove timings. We talked a lot of about push/shove\nodds with the blind levels. It got down 3 way where I lost four 40/60s in a\nrow. My chip lead dwindled to average until we were all about even. Unfortunate\nsince I was a favorite to take it all down. Since the blinds were so large,\nit became a shove-fest so we negotiated a chop.  I shot the shit with the reg\noutside, I kind of wanted to learn more about him but I went home to come back\nlater for the next freeroll.\n\n## 5pm Freeroll - Third Place for $90\n\nChicago (whom you may know from my previous posts) was in this one. I love\nplaying against him since I target him every tournament. He's an aggrodonk so I\njust tighten up and value-bet away. Though he gave me trouble in a couple of\nhands, and he was running super red hot. He went to win the freeroll, which\nis great because it'll encourage him to play more. He won two flips to knock\nme out. But I want to talk about several different hands with Chicago.\n\n### Facing a Donk Shove with Top Pair Okay Kicker\n\nI isolate two limpers on the button with A8o. Chicago calls from the BB and the\nlimpers fold. Flop comes 49A two-tone. Chicago open-shoves. I tank. Chicago\nloves playing any Ax, he'll never fold them. So A9/A4 does this as well as\npossibly any set. He doesn't need to slowplay because I already represent a\nhigh-ace hand with my large raise preflop. I saw this as trying to get value by\nrepresenting a bluff, but I know he doesn't bluff here. I fold and he shows\n49o. I adjust his calling range to any two cards when the blinds are low.\n\n### Facing a UTG 4-Bet with AK\n\nChicago raises 3x UTG. I 3bet from the big blind with AKo. He 4bet snap-shoves.\nThis is pretty standard. His range is a bit wider so I can say {JJ+, AQ+}.\nSince I have blockers to aces and kings, it's an okay call online but I expect\nto run into AA a lot here. Generally live, I should weigh snap shoves more\ntowards AA and pick a better spot but I called since I had a rebuy. His AA\nholds. I get my chips back from him next hand when I squeeze-shove AQ from\nthe SB.\n\n### Facing a Turn Shove on TQKx Board with AK\n\nChicago raises UTG during the final table with two callers. Since I had just\nseen him raise UTG with AA, my mind might have been a bit scared. I should\n3bet squeeze here since it's good against his UTG range is {88+, any two broadways}.\nBut I made the mistake of smooth calling instead of 3bet squeezing after having\njust ran into the top end of his range.\n\nBoard comes TQKr. Chicago cbets, I smooth call again, hoping to further induce\nif he's bluffing. However I called planning ahead for the turn. Chicago shoves\nthe blank turn to cover me. I tank.\n\nSince his UTG range was high pairs and two-broadways, his range on the turn\nhere consists of a lot of straights, sets, and two pair. Although my top pair\ntop kicker was a good hand, I don't see a bluff here after my call. I hadn't\ninvested too many chips and I thought I could find a better spot than this. I\nfold, and Chicago shows K5o. That was definitely not in my perception of his\nUTG range, but I still think it was a good fold.\n\n## Session Conclusion\n\nI seem to do pretty well in these turbo freerolls. They're soft like Downy.\n\n- **Went Well**: exceptional preflop final table play, turn/river double barrel bluffs\n- **Mistakes**: times I 3xed rather than shoved, putting myself into difficult\nspots on the flop.\n- **Get Better At**: not being a pussy with AKo\n- **Profit**: +$235\n","source":"_posts/051_poker10.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"Poker Session #12 - Robin Hood\"\ntype: blog\ncategory: blog\ndate: 2014-02-22\nid: poker10\ntags: poker\n\nimage:\n    url: http://i.imgur.com/QfziyOg.jpg\n---\n\nAfter heading to bed at 6am, I got up at 10:30am to play at the [Final\nTable](http://pokerportland.com), a 30-second drive away.

We talked a lot of about push/shove\nodds with the blind levels. It got down 3 way where I lost four 40/60s in a\nrow. My chip lead dwindled to average until we were all about even. Unfortunate\nsince I was a favorite to take it all down. Since the blinds were so large,\nit became a shove-fest so we negotiated a chop.  I shot the shit with the reg\noutside, I kind of wanted to learn more about him but I went home to come back\nlater for the next freeroll.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5pm-Freeroll-Third-Place-for-90\"><a href=\"#5pm-Freeroll-Third-Place-for-90\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"5pm Freeroll - Third Place for $90\"></a>5pm Freeroll - Third Place for $90</h2><p>Chicago (whom you may know from my previous posts) was in this one. I love\nplaying against him since I target him every tournament. He’s an aggrodonk so I\njust tighten up and value-bet away. Though he gave me trouble in a couple of\nhands, and he was running super red hot. He went to win the freeroll, which\nis great because it’ll encourage him to play more. He won two flips to knock\nme out. But I want to talk about several different hands with Chicago.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Facing-a-Donk-Shove-with-Top-Pair-Okay-Kicker\"><a href=\"#Facing-a-Donk-Shove-with-Top-Pair-Okay-Kicker\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Facing a Donk Shove with Top Pair Okay Kicker\"></a>Facing a Donk Shove with Top Pair Okay Kicker</h3><p>I isolate two limpers on the button with A8o. Chicago calls from the BB and the\nlimpers fold. Flop comes 49A two-tone. Chicago open-shoves. I tank. Chicago\nloves playing any Ax, he’ll never fold them. So A9/A4 does this as well as\npossibly any set. He doesn’t need to slowplay because I already represent a\nhigh-ace hand with my large raise preflop. I saw this as trying to get value by\nrepresenting a bluff, but I know he doesn’t bluff here. I fold and he shows\n49o. I adjust his calling range to any two cards when the blinds are low.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Facing-a-UTG-4-Bet-with-AK\"><a href=\"#Facing-a-UTG-4-Bet-with-AK\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Facing a UTG 4-Bet with AK\"></a>Facing a UTG 4-Bet with AK</h3><p>Chicago raises 3x UTG. I 3bet from the big blind with AKo. He 4bet snap-shoves.\nThis is pretty standard. His range is a bit wider so I can say {JJ+, AQ+}.\nSince I have blockers to aces and kings, it’s an okay call online but I expect\nto run into AA a lot here. Generally live, I should weigh snap shoves more\ntowards AA and pick a better spot but I called since I had a rebuy. His AA\nholds. I get my chips back from him next hand when I squeeze-shove AQ from\nthe SB.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Facing-a-Turn-Shove-on-TQKx-Board-with-AK\"><a href=\"#Facing-a-Turn-Shove-on-TQKx-Board-with-AK\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Facing a Turn Shove on TQKx Board with AK\"></a>Facing a Turn Shove on TQKx Board with AK</h3><p>Chicago raises UTG during the final table with two callers. Since I had just\nseen him raise UTG with AA, my mind might have been a bit scared. I should\n3bet squeeze here since it’s good against his UTG range is {88+, any two broadways}.\nBut I made the mistake of smooth calling instead of 3bet squeezing after having\njust ran into the top end of his range.</p>\n<p>Board comes TQKr. Chicago cbets, I smooth call again, hoping to further induce\nif he’s bluffing. However I called planning ahead for the turn. Chicago shoves\nthe blank turn to cover me. I tank.</p>\n<p>Since his UTG range was high pairs and two-broadways, his range on the turn\nhere consists of a lot of straights, sets, and two pair. Although my top pair\ntop kicker was a good hand, I don’t see a bluff here after my call. I hadn’t\ninvested too many chips and I thought I could find a better spot than this. I\nfold, and Chicago shows K5o. That was definitely not in my perception of his\nUTG range, but I still think it was a good fold.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Session-Conclusion\"><a href=\"#Session-Conclusion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Session Conclusion\"></a>Session Conclusion</h2><p>I seem to do pretty well in these turbo freerolls.

To\ncommemorate this multispecial day, I am taking the night off to recap my last\nten poker session posts, to reflect on how far I have come (so far) from the\nonline days, and to talk about the lost poker session of my time playing poker\nin Las Vegas.\n\n---\n\n## Ten Posts, Twelve Sessions\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"/css/poker_chart.css\"/>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/js/lib/d3.min.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<svg id=\"poker-chart\"></svg>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/js/poker-chart.js\"></script>\n\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\n  A little <a href=\"/blog/d3\">d3.js</a> chart of my recent poker earnings.\n</span></div>\n\nIt's the perfect time to do \"administrative\" work, meaning keep count\nof numbers and such.

Keeps going up through 75k hands.\n</span></div>\n\nThe [transition from online](/blog/poker) to live poker was a godsend for me.\nAlthough online poker was much more accessible, I believe it was a deterrent to my poker growth.\nI would play thousands of online hands in an hour\nwhereas I might only play 50 live hands in the same amount of\ntime. Although that sounds great for online, the problem was that each mistake I made online became\nlost in the sea of hands. When playing live, because the hands go by so slowly,\nI recall a larger number of hands. Each mistake I make becomes magnified live.\n\nSo when I go home and blog about a session, I delibrately analyze and look into\neach tough decision I face. This is an effective way to plug leaks. When I\nadjust my game in this reflective manner, I am able to easily assimilate these\nchanges into my game for next session.\n\nOnline, I'd just play shitloads of hands and not review my hands afterwards.\nAlthough I'd watch poker training videos, read forums and books, I didn't\ntarget or focus down on my mistakes like I do now.\n\nSince I can only play one table, the hands go by slower, and it's live, I now\nam much better at gaining reads and exploiting individual opponents'\ntendencies.  Online, I would use a HUD that would summarize every opponent in a\nseries of numbers (e.g. voluntary-put-in-pot-%, preflop-raise-%, 3-bet-%,\nfold-to-cbet-%).  Combine that with playing 4-6 tables at once, and I ended up\nplaying on autopilot Although I did well in the microstakes (it was hard not\nto), I had always felt plateaued.\n\n## A Computer Science Education\n\nThe difference between now and then was not only the transition to live poker,\nbut my college career in computer science. Back when I was a freshman computer\nscience student, I was pretty addicted to online poker. I did well in my\nclasses but brought my laptop to lectures to play poker (though not much\ndifferent from playing games on my phone in junior year and skipping classes\nsenior year). I was used to the high school life of\nnot-having-to-study-and-still-get-As.\n\nBut my journey through computer science has changed the way I learn.  Computer\nscience is a concept-oriented subject. It is best learned through application\n(in most cases, programming) and not memorization.  I would watch poker videos\nbut not be able to effectively apply these concepts in practice. I would take\nin concepts superficially and let them sit.\n\nComputer science also taught me to learn iteratively. Like a for-loop or an\niterative-based software engineering model. Each session I find mistakes. Then\neach hand review session I analyze and patch those mistakes. Rinse and repeat.\n\nI am improving each session by **communicating** and **expressing my thought\nprocess** in the form of these Poker Session blog posts. Not only do I mature,\nbut I am able to look back, share, and also improve my writing.\n\n## Lost Vegas\n\nAs a bonus, there was one poker session that I have yet to share: my trip to Vegas\nduring the winter break of 2013. Mozilla had given everyone time\noff for the holidays allowing me to go on a carefree road trip with my\ngirlfriend. I had prepared by purchasing *Harrington on Hold'em Vol. 1*\nfrom Powell's City of Books that was across the street from the Mozilla office.\nI think this trip to Vegas triggered something; it rebirthed and renewed my\ninterest in poker. To me, that book purchase was a PTSD flashback. I was a\nrelapsing 4-year-clean junkie.\n\nI played at four casinos in Vegas:\n\n- The Bellagio\n- The Luxor\n- The Wynn\n- The Venetian\n\n### The Bellagio\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/t0NV4Qe.jpg)\n\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\n  Should have gotten one of those back massages.\n</span></div>\n\nChristmas Day. I had been reading my Harrington book in the van on the drive\nfrom LA. It was all coming back. Cbets, board textures, double barrels, ranges.\nBut I was rusty.\n\nWe arrived at the Bellagio where I signed up for $1/$3 no-limit hold'em. There\nwas a wait list so I picked up a *Poker Player* magazine and sat to read at a\nvideo poker machine. *\"Kevin!\"*, my name was called. I grabbed my $200 in chips\nand headed to a table. I sat to the left of an old Asian tourist and to the\nright of a Russian-looking baldie.\n\nAs a funny strategy, I had my girlfriend sitting behind me so I could like an\nAsian tourist fish.\n\nAfter about half an hour of play, I was up about $30 largely due to a\nsuccessful cbet and a successful double-barrel bluff on a paired turn.\nHit and run.\n\n### The Luxor\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/DloUMdJ.jpg)\n\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\n  The Luxor floor.\n</span></div>\n\nLater around midnight, my girlfriend and I went back to the Luxor, our\nEgyptian-themed pyramid hotel, to find her dad and uncle. They had been eyeing\nthe poker table that morning but against my good advice, the uncle was sat at a\npoker table. He was free money if I ever saw it, and indeed he was stuck a\nbuy-in.\n\nThey persuaded me to play so they could watch and learn, offering to stake for\n50% of the earnings and 50% of the losses, though I didn't need the stake.\nI didn't want to play at midnight, but I sat at the Luxor tables anyways.\n\nI had been enticed by two Chinese tourist girls sharing a seat and a couple of\nold Asian guys. My bumhunting targets are old people, Asians, and\ntourists. They matched all of the above. Unfortunately the girls were felted\nbefore I got to sit.\n\nWhiel I played, the uncle was walking around the table, awkwardly standing\ncrotch-to-back behind other players, to which someone remarked.\n\n*\"can we get this guy a bit farther from me? He makes me uncomfortable. He's a\nlurker, you know?\"*\n\nCame in a couple of locals, and the table dried out pretty quickly. I managed\nto make about $25 after another half hour, mostly from one 3bet/cbet bluff. We\nexchanged Christmas presents in the hotel room and ended the day.\n\n### The Wynn\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/fyvhUkl.jpg)\n\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\n  The Christmas-themed Wynn floor.\n</span></div>\n\nTo put it short, I did not win at the Wynn. We were north the strip since my\ngirlfriend had childhood connections to get us free tickets to the normally-$50\nWynn Christmas-time buffet. While we were there, I sat for some more.\n\nAlthough it started off swell, it didn't end as well. I paid off a guy with top\npair and was rivered by another guy for a cooler. After an hour and a half, I\nwas stuck a buy-in. But the night was young for redemption.\n\n### The Venetian\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/phqQ3tO.jpg)\n\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\n  Dealer does not approve. But he was cool about it.\n</span></div>\n\nWe were exploring the decor of the famous casinos and hotels as we walked our\nway back to the Luxor on the other end of the strip. I heard about\nVenice-themed Venetian, how it might have been soft. We walked past the indoor\nwater canal with the sky-painted ceilings, down the stairs to have one final go\non our last night of Vegas.\n\nI doubled up with queens within the first few hands to recoup the buy-in. There\nwere rich middle-eastern businessmen tourists on my left and right. Good seat\nfor a good recovery.\n\nAbout $40 up coming out of Vegas. Though the amount wasn't important, it was\nthe spur of my poker addiction for the next few months that became the takeaway\nfrom this experience. Though the money is sometimes nice too...\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/uzx3gPo.jpg)\n\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\n  Not-so-humble brag.\n</span></div>\n","source":"_posts/052_poker11.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"Poker Session Special - Recap and Vegas\"\ntype: blog\ncategory: blog\ndate: 2014-02-24\nid: poker11\ntags: poker\n\nimage:\n    url: http://i.imgur.com/PSPAMNA.jpg\n    caption: Double-barrelin' at the Bellagio.\n---\n\n[Ten posts and three months ago](/blog/poker-live), I started a journey through\nthe live poker ranks of Portland.

But thermal patch (that resembled a\nMaxipad for the neck) and ibuprofen and it was as good as moderately strained.\nToday, I gave my 30-day notice to my NW Portland apartment with plans to move\nto Corvallis for a couple of months where I plan on checking out at the [Black\nDiamond Poker Club](http://www.bdpokerclub.com/). But tonight, I had to ignore\nmy neck and the move and focus on [Final Table's](http://pokerportland.com)\n$5000 guarantee. Out of 95 people, I made it to the final 7 where we negotiated\na seven way chop for $1064 each. The game ran from 7pm until the dark dredges\nof 4am.\n\n---\n\nCoincidentally on the bus ride to the club, I met another poker player headed\nto the Aces Players Club, and we just talked poker. He had seen me reading\nmy poker book. Having Full Tilt recently refund my poker balance also made for\na good starter.\n\n## 6pm $5000 Guaranteed - Seven Way Chop for $1064\n\nFriday night is one of the biggest, and most profitable, times to play\nPortland. The Portland poker scene is active, and it just comes alive after a\nlong week of work for many. I had played at Encore's Friday night big game but\ndidn't make it too far so I was counting on Final Table's weaker field. With 95\nentrants including all the rebuys and addons, the prize pool went up over\n$9000.\n\nFor the first few hours, I played mostly flawless ABC poker. I value bet\nsuccessfully when I was ahead (such as triple barrelling JJ on a low board). I\nalso found myself taking less spewy stabs in multiway pots now.\n\nMidway into the tournament, my stack size was dwindling relative to the blinds\nso I started to make shove moves to replenish the stack. I was looking to make\na move for several rounds but found few good spots. Because it took me a while\nto find my spot, I actually got someone to fold AQ with my CO shove with A5!\nThat had actually happened several times, and it's amazing how much respect I\ncan get sometimes on the table when my shove range is so ridiculously wide.\n\nWhen it came to the bubble, the game really slowed down. Though I played\naggressively enough on the bubble to build up a good stack. There was a 26-year\nold Viet guy who owned an auto body shop that gave me some troubles when he\nflatted my raises making me play postflop out of position. But I elected to\nplay weak-tight postflop which minimized my losses.\n\nI went to the final table at around 3am with an average stack. I made a couple\nof moves here and there but I tightened up to watch the shortstacks bust. After\n3 people knocked out, at 4am, and with the huge blinds (chip leader had 12 big\nblinds), we agreed on an even seven-way chop so we could all go home and sleep.\nFirst place would have paid $2810, second at $1660.

Unfortunately, after getting home at\n4am, I was not able to wake up for my favorite 11am freeroll. Getting up at 1pm\nthough was good enough. I again took first place in the $960-pot freeroll for a\n$360 finish. Looking back on my stats over six freeroll tournaments, I have a\n**740% ROI** ($150 to earn $1260).\n\n---\n\n## The Juiciness of the Final Table Freerolls\n\nCrushing the freerolls.\n\n- 1/25/14: 1st for $355\n- 1/25/14: 1st for $235\n- 2/02/01: Bust for $0 (straight over straight cooler)\n- 2/22/14: Three way chop for $220\n- 2/22/14: 3rd for $90\n- 3/01/14: 1st for $360\n\nA freeroll is a tournament where the buyin is free and the house guarantees\n(spots) the prize pool. At the Final Table, they spot $300.  Though players put\nin enough money through rebuys and addons such that the prize pool is no longer\nguaranteed by the house but by the players.\n\nThe concept of a **free**roll and house guarantee allures other players to come\nplay wild and loose, *\"my buyin is free, and rebuys are only $15!\"*. Rather\nthan thinking the tourney is free, it is advantageous to pay for a full stack\nto maximize the ability to win large pots from players that come on top of the\nearly stage donkfest. I just think of it as a $30 turbo ($15 pre-addon, $15\naddon) against shortstacks. A turbo tournament is a game in which the blinds\nraise a very quick pace (every 12 minutes).\n\nWhy are these freerolls so easy? Players are very loose since it's a freeroll.\nLimping, chasing, shoving preflop with marginal hands. There is a donkfest at\nthe beginning where some players come out with a large stack, and it is easy to\nlongball for a good stack yourself. But ironically the key to winning these\nfreerolls is not winning huge pots, but rather stack awareness.\n\n### Stack Awareness\n\nLeading us to the second reason, that other players do not have stack awareness\nduring these turbos. Players do not adjust to the large blinds and think of\ntheir stack in an absolute rather than a relative perspective. A player with a\nchip lead might think they are healthy because they have more chips than\neveryone else, but if the blinds are high relative to their stack, they\nactually should be feeling desparate and be making moves.\n\nWinning these freerolls are all about recognizing your \"M-ratio\", or the number\nof rounds you can survive before being blinded out. Once my M-ratio falls below\n6, which happens pretty quickly to everyone, I make a lot of moves. I shove\nwide into unopened or limped pots in late position to pick up the dead money,\nand if I am called I still have a chance to win. It is about combining fold\nequity with pot equity to steal tons of blinds to quickly replenish and build a\nstack. Each successful steal can increase your stack by 20%. In the off-chance\nyou get called, your cards are still live.\n\nLast but not least, I have reads on several players that frequent the weekends\nthat give me information in determining the timing of my pushes.\n\n## 5pm $300 Freeroll - 1st Place for $360\n\nAt the final table, a guy named loose-passive Asian gambler named Raj was on my\nimmediate left. We went at it a lot in blind vs blind battles. I had earlier\nshoved his limp with T8s to double up. He limped into my BB, I shove, he\nfolded. I win a three-way all-in after shoving with K3o for king high.\n\nRaj min-raises my BB, and stop-and-go'ed a 774 flop with 26s. An messy lookin'\nobnoxious middle-aged woman (call her Hags) *intelligently* remarked, *\"hey, if\nyou shoved preflop, he would have folded!\"*. No shit, Sherlock, I will remember\nto soulread his cards from now on. Thankfully, she busted out soon after.\n\nWe went to break with four players left. I was the shortest stack, but with\nthese blinds, stack size did not matter. I came back from the break aggressive\nand firing, going all-in four hands in a row. Players were way too tight, and\nwith the steals, I commanded the chip lead. I lost a flip a soon after to\nbecome short stack again, but kept up the aggression and stole more pots.\n\nRaj limped into my BB, I shove with KK, he calls with ATo to bust. He probably\nshould have accepted the chop were negotiating earlier. It was down to heads up\nwith me and an old Viet-looking guy (call him Phet). He was very short stacked.\nI tell him *\"I'm probably going to shove with my next hand with any two\ncards\"*. I shove with A6o, and it holds against QTo to win the tournament.\n\nI remember to tip the dealers well with this time, 11%.\n\n## 3pm $25 Freezeout - Busted\n\nIt was fun and games at this table. Unfortunately, I lost a AK vs TT flip, and\ndid a loose isolation to get it all in against two players with an open-ended\nstraight draw and overcard. Hags kept talking obnoxiously to me about hands I\nreally couldn't care about if I tried. I hate single-table SNGs and without the\nguarantee, the prize pool was as weak as Monday to Friday.\n\n## Session Conclusions\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/sqzy2IW.jpg)\n\n- **Went Well:** final table and shove-fold play\n- **Mistakes:** a bit of a spew after losing a flip and making too loose of an iso with A4o\n- **Get Better At**: determining who, when, and with what to iso.

I had a healthy\nstack with at least a guaranteed $790 payout after I had put $225 in. With AA,\nI lose an 80/20 (80% chance to win) all-in after the flop to bust out right\nbefore the substantial pay bumps. *Shock, denial, anger, bargaining,\ndepression, and then acceptance*. After playing solid for 10 hours, I do the\nlong skate home, can't help but thinking of the thousands I was practically\nguaranteed. Just to rub it in, the club posted on FB the picture of the guy\nthat sucked out on me right after I busted pretty saying *\"look how many chips\nhe has!!!\"*.\n\n---\n\n## Final Table $80K - 15th Place for $790\n\nThe club was packed at 300 people. Hot, humid, bustling. I had reserved my spot\ntwo weeks prior for a $150 buy-in. I saw all the familiar faces of the Portland\npoker scene, this was the place to be. Everyone was dreaming about the $20K 1st\nplace prize, but for most people they were already drawing dead. But I didn't\nplan on it being me.\n\nI played a bit loose the first hour, making a couple of mistakes, but able to\naggressively gain back chips. I had good reads on a LAG and was able to get in\na couple of good squeezes and 3bets. And there was a calling station fish on my\nright. There was a TAG wearing Beats (by Dre) on my left but we didn't have too\nmuch trouble with each other. Stayed at that table for 5 hours. With breaks in\nbetween, I had some Burger King and some bottled coffee from the mini-mart next\ndoor.\n\nMidway into the tournament, like Katniss, I caught fire. I was dealt QQ five\ntimes with a couple hours, getting it all in preflop everytime. They held every\ntime to give me the chip lead with 70 people left.\n\nIn the last three tables, I cooled down and showed down some second-best hands,\nbut was able to still steal aggressively (preflop raise/cbet, resteals, button\nmin-raises, open all-ins).

Because I was dissatisfied\nwith the incoherency of the official AngularJS docs. I started writing this\nAngularJS guide on weekends during my senior year in college. But since\nstarting full-time at Mozilla, my motivation and energy waned. So I am\npublishing it on my blog for the good of The Web!\n\nThis introduction comes complete with live demos and [open-sourced\nexamples](http://github.com/ngokevin/angularbook).\n\n---\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [ch.1 - AngularJS](/blog/angular-1)\n- [ch.2 - Scopes](/blog/angular-2)\n- [ch.3 - Controllers](/blog/angular-3)\n- [ch.4 - Templates](/blog/angular-4)\n- [ch.5 - Forms](/blog/angular-5)\n- [Directives](/blog/angularslider)\n- [Unit Testing](/blog/angular-unit-testing)\n\n## AngularJS\n\nAngularJS, or Angular, is a **model-view-controller** (MVC) client-side\nJavascript (JS) application framework that features two-way data binding and\nenhances HTML to be more declarative, expressive, and dynamic-friendly. Let us\nget some prerequisite concepts out of the way before we dive into hello-\nworldish code.\n\n---\n\n## MVC\n\nMVC is a development pattern (or paradigm, if you will) that revolves around a\nseparation of concerns. I will describe MVC and then apply its concepts to\nAngular.\n\n- The **model** holds the data and state.\n- The **view** is what the user sees.\n- The **controller** is the glue between the model and view.\n\nThey connect together. The model powers everything in the background with its\ndata, though is aware of only itself. The view polls the model for its current\nstate. Interactions in the view are recognized by the controller to update the\nmodel. An analogy might be a photographer holding a photoshoot with a\nsupermodel.\n\n- The supermodel's pose is the current state.\n- The photographer views the supermodel through the camera lens.\n- The photographer directs the supermodel to change poses.\n\nAngular's development pattern is MVC, and Angular strictly adheres to this\nseparation of concerns. Though in Angular jargon, it is employed more like\nscope-template-controller. Worry not, these concepts will be explained once you\nare ready, young padawan. Until these concepts are presented properly, we will\nstill refer to MVC components as model-view-controller.\n\n## Two-Way Data Binding\n\nRemember when I mentioned that the model's state is pushed to the view. Well,\nAngular features **two-way data binding**. Not only does the view update\nwhenever the model changes, but changes to the view automatically updates\nback to the model.\n\nThis is powerful. It permits us to write less middleman code between the model\nand view. Instead we let the model and view go outside and play with each\nother, no supervision needed. Referring to our earlier analogy, it would be as\nif the photographer struck the same poses in sync with the supermodel.\n\nThis saves a lot of trouble by eliminating manual DOM manipulation. I was once\nwriting an non-Angular web app. It had an ugly function that synced my model\nwith my view via large block of jQuery code. Every time the user interacted\nwith the page, I had to call that expensive block of jQuery code to update the\npage. I was displeased by this. Thus, I turned to Angular for its two-way\ndata binding.\n\n## Client-Side Templating\n\nThough, the two-way data binding does not happen without a little push. We need\nto hook things together from the client-side **template**. Client-side\ntemplates are usually HTML files that are augmented to be more dynamic. They\nare often sprinkled with traditional control structures such as loops and\nconditionals. And they contain placeholders that represent specified variables.\n\nIf you are familiar with server-side web framework templating, it is just that\nbut on the client and, in our case, manipulated via JS.\n\nAngular templates are a special flavor of templates. Along with control\nstructures and variable placeholders, they are also capable of declaring two-\nway data bindings and event handlers. In our next example\n*Invitation to Angular*, we will get a first glimpse at some Angular.\n\n### Example\n\nIn *Invitation to Angular*, we will sync an HTML text input element with a\n```p``` element to demonstrate two-way data binding.\n\n    ::html\n    <!doctype html>\n    <html ng-app>\n      <head>\n        <script src=\"../lib/js/angular.min.js\"></script>\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <h1>Invitation to Angular</h1>\n        <input type=\"text\" ng-model=\"mySpecies\" placeholder=\"What is your species?\">\n        <p>\n          It is a great honor to bask\n          in the presence of a {{ mySpecies || 'human' }}.\n        </p>\n        <p>Angular humbly welcomes you.</p>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n\n```ngApp``` bootstraps the our document to Angular, and we have the input\nbinded to a model variable species via the ```ngModel``` **directive**.\nAll we need to know about directives, for now, is that they allow us to\nregister behavior to the document object model (DOM), the browser's\nrepresentation of HTML.\n\nNote when a directive's name is used as an HTML attribute such as in *Baby\nExample*, it is spelled with a hyphen (e.g. ```ng-app```). However, the\ncanonical name for directives in Angular is spelled with camel case (e.g.\n```ngApp```).\n\nNow back to the example, the input will read *human* by default if\n```mySpecies``` is not set. We accomplish this with an Angular **expression**\nin the variable placeholder, {% raw %}{{ mySpecies || 'human' }}{% endraw %}An expression is\nlike inline code in the template that Angular evaluates.\n\nSay we type \"cyberman\" into the input box. ```species```'s value in the\nbackend will automatically update to \"cyberman\" as we type. Since we have\n```species``` under two-way data binding, no ```onchange``` event handlers are\nrequired.\n\n<iframe src=\"/files/ng-book/examples/invitationtoangular/index.html\"></iframe>\n\n## Up Next\n\nWith some concepts on our belt and a sneak peek at Angular in action, we will\ntake a deeper gander at the model side of Angular, the scope, in\n[ch.2 Scopes](/blog/angular-2).\n","source":"_posts/060_angular1.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"ng-okevin's Angular ch.1 - AngularJS\"\ntype: blog\ncategory: blog\ndate: 2014-04-07\nid: angular-1\ntags: [code, angularjs]\n\nimage:\n    url: http://i.imgur.com/pg5I3l8.jpg\n    caption: Unleash the floodgates!

Let us\nget some prerequisite concepts out of the way before we dive into hello-\nworldish code.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"MVC\"><a href=\"#MVC\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"MVC\"></a>MVC</h2><p>MVC is a development pattern (or paradigm, if you will) that revolves around a\nseparation of concerns. I will describe MVC and then apply its concepts to\nAngular.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>model</strong> holds the data and state.</li>\n<li>The <strong>view</strong> is what the user sees.</li>\n<li>The <strong>controller</strong> is the glue between the model and view.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They connect together. The model powers everything in the background with its\ndata, though is aware of only itself. The view polls the model for its current\nstate. Interactions in the view are recognized by the controller to update the\nmodel. An analogy might be a photographer holding a photoshoot with a\nsupermodel.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The supermodel’s pose is the current state.</li>\n<li>The photographer views the supermodel through the camera lens.</li>\n<li>The photographer directs the supermodel to change poses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Angular’s development pattern is MVC, and Angular strictly adheres to this\nseparation of concerns. Though in Angular jargon, it is employed more like\nscope-template-controller. Worry not, these concepts will be explained once you\nare ready, young padawan. Until these concepts are presented properly, we will\nstill refer to MVC components as model-view-controller.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Two-Way-Data-Binding\"><a href=\"#Two-Way-Data-Binding\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Two-Way Data Binding\"></a>Two-Way Data Binding</h2><p>Remember when I mentioned that the model’s state is pushed to the view.

Ready, player one?"},"weight":3,"_content":"\nAngular controllers help us initialize the initial state and add behavior to\nscope objects. Recall that controllers, in the classic MVC pattern, handle the\nbusiness logic. They are the glue between the controller and the view.\nControllers tell the view about changes to the model and manipulate the model\nwhen asked by from the view.\n\n---\n\nIn the [ch.2 Scopes](/blog/angular-2), we had briefly introduced\ncontrollers by necessity. Controllers are intertwined with scopes in the sense\nthat controllers\n\n- use scopes to expose their methods to the template to use in expressions.\n- define methods that can modify properties on the scope.\n- can register ```$watches``` on the model.\n\n### Example\n\nIn *Sup, World*, we will print \"Sup, world\" to demonstrate a more correct\ndeclaration of controllers that do not reside in the global JS scope.\n\nRather, it is more correct to create an Angular ```module``` and use its\n```controller``` factory function to register a controller to the view, to not\npollute the global namespace.\n\n    ::js\n    var app = anglar.module('SupWorldApp', []);\n\n    app.controller('SupWorldCtrl', function($scope) {\n        $scope.targetOfSalutation = 'World';\n    });\n\n```module``` is a global place used to create and register Angular modules.\nThough we have not covered them yet, along with controllers, types of Angular\nmodules include services, directives, and filters.\n\nWe pass in the name of the controller along with the controller function with\nits dependencies it wants injected.\n\nTo use our module, along with our registered ```SupWorldCtrl``` controller,\nwe must pass the name of our module into the top-level ```ngApp``` directive.\nAgain, we use the ```ngController``` directive to create the scope and\nassociate our controller.\n\n    ::html\n    <!doctype html>\n    <html ng-app=\"SupWorldApp\">\n      <body ng-controller=\"SupWorldCtrl\">\n        <h1>Sup, {{ targetOfSalutation }}</h1>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n\nThe rest is just like before, this time with a greener global namespace.\n\n## Dependency Injection\n\nWe have already briefly trotted around dependency injection. Dependency\ninjection a pattern of passing instance variables into an object rather than\nhard-coding the instance variables from within the object. Big term for a\nrather simple concept.\n\nDependency injection is beneficial because it provides decoupling of code, thus\nimproving testability and maintainability.\n\n### Example\n\nThe following two examples demonstrate functions getting a hold of their\ndependencies without dependency injection. These methods hard-code their\ndepedencies, making it difficult to stub out or mock the dependency in tests.\n\n*No dependency injection: create the dependency*\n\n    ::js\n    function SomeClass() {\n        this.someDependency = new SomeDependency();\n    }\n\n*No dependency injection: global dependency*\n\n    ::js\n    var someDependency = new SomeDependency();\n    function SomeClass() {\n        this.someDependency = someDependency;\n    }\n\nBy not hard-coding the dependency, we can change them whenever, such as during\ntesting.\n\n*Dependency injection*\n\n    ::js\n    function SomeClass(someDependency) {\n        this.someDependency = someDependency;\n    }\n\n### Dependency Injection in Controllers\n\nEarlier in *Sup, World*, we properly registered a controller to the view using\nan Angular ```module``` and its factory function, ```controller```. There is\nyet a more correct method, involving dependency injection.\n\nJavascript minifiers and obfuscators renames parameters of functions. This\nwould disable Angular's ability to infer a controller's dependencies by its\nparameter names. To get around this, we could either use the ```$inject```\nmethod of controllers, or we can inject dependencies using an inline\nannotation.\n\n### Example\n\nIn *Sup, World*, we will again print \"Sup, World\" using a different method\nto demonstrate declaring controllers with proper dependency injection.\n\n    ::js\n    // With better dependency injection.\n    app.controller('SupWorldCtrl', ['$scope', function(scope) {\n        scope.targetOfSalutation = 'World';\n    }]);\n\nIn an array , we pass the names of the dependencies we want as strings. We then\npass the controller constructor with its dependencies as its parameters in the\nsame order. Note we can name the function parameters what we want as long as\nthey are in the same order as we injected them.\n\nAs well as controllers, dependency injection can be used in the other Angular\nfactory methods for creating services, filters, and directives.\n\n## Methods in the Controller\n\nWe can set a method on the scope from within a controller and can call the\nmethod from the template in an expression. It is better practice to place\npresentational behavior in the controller, as to please MVC's separation of\nconcerns. Defining behavior in the view would not only be incorrect but would\nalso be more difficult as Angular expressions are inherently limited.\n\n### Example\n\nIn *Jack in the Box*, we will create a button that, on a random click, pop goes\nthe weasel, to demonstrate using methods in the controller.\n\n    ::js\n    app.controller('JackInTheBoxCtrl', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n        $scope.crank = function() {\n            if (Math.random() < 0.3) {\n                $scope.pop = 'Pop Goes the Weasel!';\n            }\n        };\n    }]);\n\nWe define a method in the controller as a property on the scope. We use\n```Math.random()``` to set the value of ```pop``` on a *random* click,\nsomething we would not be able to do from the template.\n\n    ::html\n    <body ng-controller=\"JackInTheBoxCtrl\">\n      <h1>Jack in the Box</h1>\n      <div><h2>{{ pop }}</h2></div>\n      <button ng-click='crank()'>Crank</button>\n    </body>\n\nThen we can call it from the template by passing it to the ```ngClick```\ndirective, with parenthesis to indicate a function. We could even pass\nparameters to the function if we desired.\n\n<iframe src=\"/files/ng-book/examples/jackinthebox/index.html\"></iframe>\n\n## Controller Inheritance\n\nController inheritance is based on scope inheritance. Just as scopes can\ninherit from other scopes, controllers can inherit from other controllers.\nInner controllers contain their own scopes, while those scopes inherit from\ntheir outer controllers' scopes.\n\nTo create a child controller, declare it within the element of the parent\ncontroller with the ```ngController``` directive.\n\n### Example\n\nIn *No Church in the Wild*, we will use Kanye West's bar, \"What's a mob to a\nking? What's a king to a god? What's a god to a non-believer?\" to create a a\nlittle food chain heirarchy.\n\n    ::html\n    <body ng-init=\"alpha = 'Kevin'\">\n      <h1>No Church in the Wild<h1>\n      <div ng-controller=\"NonBelieverCtrl\">\n        {{ alpha }}\n        <div ng-controller=\"GodCtrl\">\n          {{ alpha }}\n          <div ng-controller=\"KingCtrl\">\n            {{ alpha }}\n            <div ng-controller=\"MobCtrl\">\n              {{ alpha }}\n\nThe ```body``` element encompasses the root scope. For each ```ng-\ncontroller```, another child controller is added to the heirarchy. The root\nscope's value for ```alpha``` is initialized to \"Kevin\".\n\nWhen the ```NonBelieverCtrl``` child controller is created, a new scope is\ncreated that inherits from the root scope, therefore inheriting ```alpha```'s\nvalue of \"Kevin\". But in the ```NonBelieverCtrl``` controller, we will override\nthat initial value.\n\n    ::js\n    app.controller('NonBelieverCtrl', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n        $scope.alpha = 'Non-Believer';\n    }]);\n\n    app.controller('GodCtrl', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n        $scope.alpha = 'God';\n    }]);\n\nWe can then continue going down the chain, overriding \"Non-Believer\" with \"God\"\nin ```GodCtrl```, overriding \"God\" with \"King\", then finally overriding \"King\"\nwith \"Mob\".\n\n<iframe src=\"/files/ng-book/examples/nochurchinthewild/index.html\"></iframe>\n\n## Up Next\n\nTime to move onto the last component of *MVC*, the view. We have seen the role\nof the controller, how it interacts with the scope. Having exposed some\ncapabilties of the controller, we now have more expressive power in the\nview. In [ch.4 Templates](/blog/angular-4), we will explore more about Angular\ntemplates, although having already been using them in our examples.\n","source":"_posts/062_angular3.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"ng-okevin's Angular ch.3 - Controllers\"\ntype: blog\ncategory: blog\ndate: 2014-04-05\nid: angular-3\ntags: [code, angularjs]\n\nimage:\n    url: http://i.imgur.com/m3VNrQk.jpg\n    caption: The controller is in your hands.

But in the ```NonBelieverCtrl``` controller, we will override\nthat initial value.\n\n    ::js\n    app.controller('NonBelieverCtrl', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n        $scope.alpha = 'Non-Believer';\n    }]);\n\n    app.controller('GodCtrl', ['$scope', function($scope) {\n        $scope.alpha = 'God';\n    }]);\n\nWe can then continue going down the chain, overriding \"Non-Believer\" with \"God\"\nin ```GodCtrl```, overriding \"God\" with \"King\", then finally overriding \"King\"\nwith \"Mob\".\n\n<iframe src=\"/files/ng-book/examples/nochurchinthewild/index.html\"></iframe>\n\n## Up Next\n\nTime to move onto the last component of *MVC*, the view.

Remember the\nmodel holds the data and state of an MVC application. Besides applying context\nagainst which expressions are evaluated, scopes allow us to:\n\n- access and manipulate the model.\n- set event listeners to watch for whenever the model changes.\n- enlighten Angular about asynchronous changes to the model.\n\n---\n\nEach Angular application has exactly one **root scope**, which can have child\nscopes that inherit from it.\n\n    ::js\n    $rootScope.color = 'black';\n    childScope = $rootScope.$new();  // Child scope's color is 'black'.\n    childScope.color = 'yellow';  // Child scope's color is 'yellow'.\n\nWe can assign properties to the scope to update the model, as seen above.\nThough, we can implicitly use the scope from the template to manipulate the\nmodel. For now, we will be working with the root scope for simplicity.\n\n### Example\n\nIn *Black and Yellow*, we will create two buttons that toggle the color of a\ncircle between two colors, black and yellow, to demonstrate basic use of the\nscope.\n\n    ::html\n    <h1>Black and Yellow</h1>\n    <div style=\"background: {{ color }}\" ng-init=\"color = 'white'\"></div>\n    <button ng-click=\"color= 'black'\">Black</button>\n    <button ng-click=\"color= 'yellow'\">Yellow</button>\n\nWe instantiate the ```color``` attribute on the root scope with the\n```ngInit``` directive. We have the ```div``` watch for changes to ```color```\nwith the placeholder. Whenever ```color``` changes, the background of the\n```div``` changes as well.\n\nTo register this behavior with the buttons, we use the ```ngClick``` directive\nwhich attaches an event handler to the DOM element. For the yellow button, we\nattach the expression, ```color = 'yellow'```, which will set the attribute of\nthe scope to be \"yellow\".\n\n<iframe src=\"/files/ng-book/examples/blackandyellow/index.html\"></iframe>\n\n## *$watch*ing the Model\n\nSometimes, we want to observe the model for changes. The ```scope``` object\nexposes an application programming interface (API), a handful abstracted useful\nfunctions. Among these functions is ```$watch```, which observes an attribute\non the scope and runs a callback function whenever that attribute changes.\n\nExplicitly using ```$watch``` allows us to run additional logic that consists\nof more than simply updating the view. Though in the previous example *Black\nand Yellow*, a ```$watch``` was still being implicitly set on ```{{ color\n}}```. Whenever ```color``` changed, ```$watch``` automatically updated the\nDOM.\n\nAside, it is worth noting that Angular prefixes the names of its objects and\nattributes with ```$``` to avoid accidental namespace collisions.\n\n### Example\n\nIn *Gentleman*, we will blink an image when both of two checkboxes are checked,\nbut to stop blinking when either of the two checkboxes are unchecked, to\ndemonstrate ```$watch```.\n\n    ::html\n    <body ng-controller=\"GentlemanCtrl\">\n      <h1>Gentleman</h1>\n      <img src=\"gentleman.png\">\n      <input type=\"checkbox\" ng-model=\"mother\">\n      <label>Mother</label>\n      <input type=\"checkbox\" ng-model=\"father\">\n      <label>Father</label>\n    </body>\n\nThis example is slightly more complex; we need to be able to conditionally set\nintervals and clear stored timeouts. This is difficult to do with Angular\nexpressions alone in the template.\n\nThus, we will be making use of a **controller**. Controllers allow us set up\nthe initial state and add behavior to scope objects, from the Javascript side.\nThe controller will give us a scope object. We can then use its ```$watch```\nfunction to observe the checkboxes.\n\nA child scope of the root scope is created under the ```ngController```\ndirective. As we see, this is one way to create child scopes. We have also been\ncreating the root scope in the template as well. The ```ngApp``` directive we\nhave been using to bootstrap our Angular applications has been creating the\nroot scope.\n\nWe pass in the name of our controller, ```GentlemanCtrl``` to associate it with\nour new scope.\n\n    ::js\n    function GentlemanCtrl($scope) {\n        var timeout;\n\n        $scope.$watch('mother', function(newVal, oldVal) {\n            if (newVal && $scope.father) {\n                // 'Mother' and 'Father' checked.\n                motherfather();\n            } else if (!newVal) {\n                // 'Mother' unchecked.\n                clearTimeout(timeout);\n            }\n        });\n\n        $scope.$watch('father', function(newVal, oldVal) {\n            if (newVal && $scope.mother) {\n                motherfather();\n            } else if (!newVal) {\n                clearTimeout(timeout);\n            }\n        });\n\n        function motherfather() {\n            timeout = setInterval(function() {\n                $('img').toggleClass('show');\n            }, 500);\n        }\n    }\n\nIn the controller, we can ask Angular for the ```$scope``` object by asking for\nit as a parameter. Angular will then supply the ```$scope``` through\n**dependency injection**. Dependency injection is a method of removing hard-\ncoded dependencies and making it possible to change them at run-time or\ncompile-time.\n\nThere are better ways of creating controllers that uses a better pattern of\ndependency injection and does not involve polluting the global namespace, ways\nwhich will be discussed in [ch.3 Controllers](/blog/angular-3),\n\nWe set a ```$watch``` on the scope on ```mother``` and ```father```. When\neither attribute changes value, the supplied callback function will execute.\n\n<iframe src=\"/files/ng-book/examples/gentleman/index.html\"></iframe>\n\n## *$apply*ing Changes from Non-Angular Runtime\n\nScopes let us notify Angular about model changes that occur outside of Angular.\nAngular splits the browser-event loop into two separate **runtimes**, or\nexecution contexts, into classical and Angular runtimes. Only operations that\nhappen within Angular runtime will propagate to, or update, the view.\n\nInstances of non-Angular runtimes include:\n\n- browser DOM events.\n- setTimeout or setInterval.\n- asynchronous XMLHttpRequests (XHR or AJAX).\n- third-party libraries such as Socket.IO.\n\nWhen the model changes through these events, we need to call ```$apply``` if we\nwant to refresh the data-binding from the model to the view. Though in most\ncases, ```$apply``` is called for you automatically. Calling ```$apply``` does\nseveral things on the backend:\n\n- enters Angular runtime.\n- executes a function within that runtime if supplied.\n- calls ```$digest``` which processes the scope's ```$watch``` list\n\nWhen calling ```$digest```, Angular enters the **digest loop**. ```$digest```\niterates over ```$watch``` list, which contain watchers that may then change\nthe model even further. This would cause ```$digest``` to then be called again.\nThis digest loop continues until the model stabilizes, when the ```$watch```\nlist no longer detects any changes.\n\n*Depiction of Angular Runtime (docs.angularjs.org)*\n\n![runtime](/files/ng-book/img/runtime.png)\n\n### Example\n\nIn *HL3 Countdown*, we will create a countdown timer with ```setInterval```\nalongside Angular to demonstrate ```$apply```.\n\n    ::js\n    function HL3CountdownCtrl($rootScope, $scope) {\n        $rootScope.countdown = 9999;\n\n        setInterval(function() {\n            $rootScope.$apply(function() {\n                $rootScope.countdown--;\n            });\n        }, 1000);\n    }\n\nFor variety, we are using ```$rootScope``` to demonstrate more of dependency\ninjection. We ask for ```$rootScope```, Angular will recognize the name and\nsupply it to us. Since dependencies are not hard-coded, we can ask for\ndependencies in any particular order.\n\nSince ```$rootScope.countdown--``` takes place within a setInterval, it runs\noutside of Angular runtime. If we were to not use ```$apply```, ```countdown```\nwould not be updated to the view, and the countdown would not run. Since we do\ncall ```$apply```, the data-binding is effectively refreshed, and the countdown\nruns.\n\n<iframe src=\"/files/ng-book/examples/hl3countdown/index.html\"></iframe>\n\nNote we put counter-decrementing code within the function passed into\n```$apply```. We could just as well call ```$apply``` on its own to achieve\nthe same effect.\n\n    ::js\n    $rootScope.countdown--;\n    $rootScope.$apply();\n\n## Up Next\n\nScopes cover the *M* in MVC.

Only operations that</div><div class=\"line\">happen within Angular runtime will propagate to, or update, the view.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">Instances of non-Angular runtimes include:</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">- browser DOM events.</div><div class=\"line\">- setTimeout or setInterval.</div><div class=\"line\">- asynchronous XMLHttpRequests (XHR or AJAX).</div><div class=\"line\">- third-party libraries such as Socket.IO.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">When the model changes through these events, we need to call ```$apply``` if we</div><div class=\"line\">want to refresh the data-binding from the model to the view. Though in most</div><div class=\"line\">cases, ```$apply``` is called for you automatically. Calling ```$apply``` does</div><div class=\"line\">several things on the backend:</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">- enters Angular runtime.</div><div class=\"line\">- executes a function within that runtime if supplied.</div><div class=\"line\">- calls ```$digest``` which processes the scope&apos;s ```$watch``` list</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">When calling ```$digest```, Angular enters the **digest loop**. ```$digest</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>iterates over <figure class=\"highlight plain\"><figcaption><span>list, which contain watchers that may then change</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">the model even further.

How\ncan we use our money most efficiently to make ourselves happiest?\n\nWe have fine choices betweem 65\" 3D plasma TVs, media-integrated BMWs and\nAudis, Tudor-style houses on the tree-lined avenue. Although we're all aware of\nthe American Dream and although we might even consciously scoff at it, is it\nreally ingrained in our heads enough to affect our purchases? Despite being\naware of materialism, we still spend on items such as an Apple product upgrades\nor matching furniture sets. But really, compared to what we could potentially\nbe allocating our money towards, are they really worth it?. Buck by buck,\nthere are happier things to spend money on and happier *ways* to spend it.\n\n---\n\n## Experiences Trumps Stuff\n\nThe happiness attained from a new toy is fleeting. When I buy a gadget, I get\nreally excited about it for a couple weeks, and then it's just another item\non the shelf. Once in freshman year, I dropped $70 on an HD camcorder. *\"Think\nabout all the cool life experiences I could record!\"*, I thought. After playing\naround with it for a bit, it got stowed away, just as Woody had when Buzz came\nto town. It wasn't the actual camcorder that I really wanted, it was thinking\nabout the future *experiences* I could have.\n\nThinking back, the best things I have ever spent my money on were experiences.\nTrips around the world, places like the cultural streets of Beijing, the\nserenity of Oahu, or the cold isolation of Alaska. They bring back warm (or\nperhaps cold) memories and instill a rush of nostalgia. It brought about\nhappiness in a way that those $100 beat-up sneakers or that now-stolen iPod\ntouch ever did.\n\nIt's changed my thoughts on getting a nice house or car. Why spend to be stuck\nat a mundane home or spend to be stuck in traffic (just in cushier seats)? I'd\nrather use the money saved from not splurging $400K on a house to see the\nworld. Spend money to be with people, go to places, attend shows, try new\nthings. You won't forget it.\n\n## Instant Gratification is a Drag\n\nIt's not only what we spend on that makes us happy, it's how we spend. When we\nspend in a way such that we attain instant gratification, such as an in-store\npurchase on credit of that new fridge or getting that candy bar now, it\ndestroys the whole fun of the waiting game. Have you ever eagerly awaited a\npackage to come for weeks? Thinking about all the future possibilites, all the\nthings you can do, all the fun you will have once that package comes. We are\nhappier when we await something eagerly in anticipation. It's about the journey\nand not the destination.\n\nJust yesterday, I booked my flight and hotel to Florida to visit my girlfriend\nworking at Disney. It's almost two months out. But every day, I'll be thinking\nabout how much fun we'll have watching the Fantasmic fireworks, how relaxing it\nwill be staying at a 1940s Atlantic-city themed Disney inn, all the delicious\nfood at the Flying Fish. With the date marked on my calendar, it makes me\nhappier every day just eagerly anticipating it.\n\nWhen you spend on something now, and defer the actual consumption or experience\nfor later, you will much more gratified. Try pre-ordering something you enjoy,\nplan trips out months ahead, or purchasing online. By practicing patience,\nyou'll probably even save a bit of cash.\n\n## Make It Scarce\n\nExperiencing something too frequently makes it less of an experience. If you\ndrink a frothy mocha cappucino every day, you become more and more desensitized\nto its creamy joys. By making something scarce by not buying or experiencing it\ntoo often, it becomes more of a treat. So if you're eating out for lunch\nevery day at nice restaurants, you might want to think about only eating out\nonce a week. Or only get expensive coffees on Fridays. It'll make those times\nyou do go out that much more satisfying, and your wallet will thank you.\n\n## Time Trumps Money\n\nDon't dwell too much on wasting your time to pinch some money. So Starbucks is\ngiving out free 12oz coffees today? Free sounds enticing but is it really worth\nthe gas, time in dreadful traffic, and waiting in line? View time as happiness.\nIf you have more time, you can do more of the things you want to do. If you\njust *feel* like you have a lot of time, you feel much more free.\n\nWith that in mind, you should consider how purchases will affect your future\ntime. Ask *\"will this really make me happier next week?\"*. If you are\ncontemplating a new TV, you might think it'll make you happier. Have so many\nfriends over to play FIFA on the so-much-HD. But television doesn't make you\nhappier or any less stressed. It's a numbing time-sink. Or perhaps think when\nyou are debating between two similar products such as a Nexus 5 or an HTC One.\nSure, when placed side-by-side, those extra megapixels and megahertz might seem\nlike a huge advantage. But think about the product in isolation and see if it\nwill really benefit your future time.\n\n## Give it Away\n\nWarren Buffett pledged to give away 99% of his wealth, whether in his lifetime\nor posthumously. Giving away, passing it forward, being charitable makes people\nhappy. Even happier had they splurged on themselves.\n\nHelping others in need makes it feel like you have a lot of extra free time to\ngive away. And feeling like you have a lot of free time is less of a boulder on\nyour back. So invest in others and invest in relationships. We're inherently\nsocial creatures although sometimes selfish. It works against us. Donate to a\ncharity where you know exactly where your money is going to, or buy something\nnice for a family member or friend without pressure.

You know, personal\nfinances. Then I wonder how we spend in order to make ourselves happier. How\ncan we use our money most efficiently to make ourselves happiest?</p>\n<p>We have fine choices betweem 65” 3D plasma TVs, media-integrated BMWs and\nAudis, Tudor-style houses on the tree-lined avenue. Although we’re all aware of\nthe American Dream and although we might even consciously scoff at it, is it\nreally ingrained in our heads enough to affect our purchases? Despite being\naware of materialism, we still spend on items such as an Apple product upgrades\nor matching furniture sets. But really, compared to what we could potentially\nbe allocating our money towards, are they really worth it?. Buck by buck,\nthere are happier things to spend money on and happier <em>ways</em> to spend it.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"Experiences-Trumps-Stuff\"><a href=\"#Experiences-Trumps-Stuff\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Experiences Trumps Stuff\"></a>Experiences Trumps Stuff</h2><p>The happiness attained from a new toy is fleeting. When I buy a gadget, I get\nreally excited about it for a couple weeks, and then it’s just another item\non the shelf. Once in freshman year, I dropped $70 on an HD camcorder. <em>“Think\nabout all the cool life experiences I could record!”</em>, I thought. After playing\naround with it for a bit, it got stowed away, just as Woody had when Buzz came\nto town. It wasn’t the actual camcorder that I really wanted, it was thinking\nabout the future <em>experiences</em> I could have.</p>\n<p>Thinking back, the best things I have ever spent my money on were experiences.\nTrips around the world, places like the cultural streets of Beijing, the\nserenity of Oahu, or the cold isolation of Alaska. They bring back warm (or\nperhaps cold) memories and instill a rush of nostalgia. It brought about\nhappiness in a way that those $100 beat-up sneakers or that now-stolen iPod\ntouch ever did.</p>\n<p>It’s changed my thoughts on getting a nice house or car. Why spend to be stuck\nat a mundane home or spend to be stuck in traffic (just in cushier seats)? I’d\nrather use the money saved from not splurging $400K on a house to see the\nworld. Spend money to be with people, go to places, attend shows, try new\nthings. You won’t forget it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Instant-Gratification-is-a-Drag\"><a href=\"#Instant-Gratification-is-a-Drag\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Instant Gratification is a Drag\"></a>Instant Gratification is a Drag</h2><p>It’s not only what we spend on that makes us happy, it’s how we spend. When we\nspend in a way such that we attain instant gratification, such as an in-store\npurchase on credit of that new fridge or getting that candy bar now, it\ndestroys the whole fun of the waiting game. Have you ever eagerly awaited a\npackage to come for weeks? Thinking about all the future possibilites, all the\nthings you can do, all the fun you will have once that package comes. We are\nhappier when we await something eagerly in anticipation. It’s about the journey\nand not the destination.</p>\n<p>Just yesterday, I booked my flight and hotel to Florida to visit my girlfriend\nworking at Disney. It’s almost two months out. But every day, I’ll be thinking\nabout how much fun we’ll have watching the Fantasmic fireworks, how relaxing it\nwill be staying at a 1940s Atlantic-city themed Disney inn, all the delicious\nfood at the Flying Fish. With the date marked on my calendar, it makes me\nhappier every day just eagerly anticipating it.</p>\n<p>When you spend on something now, and defer the actual consumption or experience\nfor later, you will much more gratified.

After an initial lessons-learned prototype that we\ndid not end up shipping due to deadline pushes, we ended up forking our current\napp store into a separate project,\n[Yogafire](http://github.com/mozilla/yogafire). This is how we made it fast.\n\n---\n\n## Make It a Packaged App\n\nOur current Marketplace that is running on phones around the world simply runs\nin an iframe within a packaged app. The decision around using an iframe was to:\n\n- Have working Persona login due to CSP restrictions\n- Have working Google Analytics due to CSP restrictions\n- Keep the ``marketplace.firefox.com`` domain for apps that specify they can only\n  be installed on that domain\n- Instant updates\n\nHowever, the iframe method can be slow. Users at least on first launch of the\napp, have to download assets (our JS, CSS, templates, and data) over the air.\n\nSince then, we have worked around all of the issues blocking us from\n\"packaging\" the Marketplace. In a packaged app, assets are pre-loaded into the\napp to be shipped with phones; users then do not have to go out to the Content\nDelivery Network (CDN) to download assets.\n\n## Pre-loading API Responses\n\nNormally the Marketplace would have to talk to our servers to get data such as\napps to display on the storefront (actually, we cache API responses on the CDN\ntoo). But nevertheless, users still have to go out to the network to download\nnecessary data.\n\nIn the optimized app store, we have a [suite of\nprograms](https://github.com/mozilla/yogafire/tree/master/lib) that download\nthe API responses into JSON files that we package with the app to ship with the\nphones.  Upon launch, the data from the JSON files are requested and pulled\ninto our cache in the background.\n\n## Multi-Layer Cache with Asynchronous Updating\n\nWe implemented a [multi-layer caching\nsystem](https://github.com/mozilla/yogafire/blob/master/hearth/media/js/db.js):\n\n- Data from pre-loaded JSON files are pulled into the localStorage cache\n- All data is then subsequently requested from the cache\n- Data requested from the cache is pulled into memory for subsequent requests\n- The cache is asynchronously updated with the API\n\nInitially, we looked at using IndexedDB due to the lack of a 5MB storage cap\nthat localStorage otherwise would have. However for our smaller data set,\nlocalStorage was marginally faster, and 5MB would be more than enough. In case\nthe 5MB cap is ever hit, we simply wipe the cache.\n\nStill, on the lower-performance phone, localStorage still was not fast enough.\nSo data that is pulled from localStorage is also stored into memory (RAM) in\ncase the data is asked for again. This way, we get to keep the persistence of\nlocalStorage alongside the faster speed of memory.\n\nWith asynchronous updating from the API, we never have to block on API\nrequests, which would otherwise a dealbreaker on EDGE networks.\n\n## Image Deferring\n\nImages, however, are by far the largest assets, which are mainly app icons and\napp screenshots. An average icon is about 4KB and an screenshot is about 20KB.\nThese kilobytes add up.\n\nSo we defer images. We have an [image\ndeferrer](https://github.com/mozilla/yogafire/blob/master/hearth/media/js/image-deferrer.js)\nthat constantly checks for images that scroll in the viewport, and if they do,\nonly then do they load.  Images outside the viewport are not loaded, saving\nbandwidth. Until then, we display a nice little Rocketship that waits for its\nqueen image to be faded in.\n\nNote, we tried out pre-loading app icons and app screenshots into the package,\nbut that bloated up the package too much. It would mean on every update we\nwanted to push out, users would have to download nearly a whole megabyte. No\ncan do. We keep the package down to 200KB.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere were loads of other things we had to do such as implement a new design,\noptimize for languages such as Hindi and regions such as India, or improve\noffline usability.

Angular forms have a built-in awareness of their\nstate, such as whether data has been inputted or whether the forms are valid.\nAngular forms provide\n\n- two-way data binding with the model.\n- form state.\n\n---\n\nWe have covered the two-way data binding in [ch.1 AngularJS](/blog/angular-1).\nForm state, however, can be used to conditionally\n\n- enable or disable form controls (e.g. buttons).\n- style the form.\n\nWith directives though, we can also achieve\n\n- custom form validation.\n- custom form controls.\n\n## Form State\n\nA bit about the backend. Angular forms and inputs are instances of\n```FormController```. As instances of ```FormController```, form and input\ndirectives contain a handful of useful properties that represent form state.\n\n- ```$pristine```: True if the user has not yet interacted with the form\n- ```$dirty```: opposite of ```$pristine```\n- ```$valid```: True if all of containing forms and controls are valid\n- ```$invalid```: opposite of ```$valid```\n- ```$error```: a JS object referencing invalid forms or a mapping of error\n  names to booleans\n\n```$error``` is a bit confusing as it has two faces. If getting the ```$error```\nattribute from a *form's* ```FormController```, it will be a reference to invalid\nform controls.\n\n    ::js\n    {\"required\": [{}], \"max\": false}\n\nElse if getting the ```$error``` attribute from an *input's*\n```FormController```, it will be a mapping of error names to booleans (with\n\"true\" indicating an error).\n\n    ::js\n    {\"required\": false, \"max\": true}\n\nTo reference all these properties though, the form and input directives need to\nbe given a ```name``` attribute to register it into scope. We can then use\nthese properties to drive form interaction and behavior.\n\n### Example\n\nIn *Muffin Button*, we will create a button that dispenses a number of muffins\nto demonstrate form states.\n\n    ::html\n    <form name=\"muffinForm\" ng-submit=\"muffins = muffinNum\">\n      <input id=\"muffinNum\" type=\"number\" name=\"muffinNumInput\"\n             ng-model=\"muffinNum\" min=\"1\" max=\"255\">\n\n      <button ng-disabled=\"muffinForm.muffinNumInput.$invalid\">\n        Dispense Muffins\n      </button>\n\n      <span ng-show=\"muffinForm.muffinNumInput.$error.max\">\n        Muffin Overload!\n      </span>\n\n      <img src=\"muffin.png\" ng-repeat=\"i in [] | range: muffins\">\n    </form>\n\n*Muffin Button* contains a number input field. Given a number, it dispenses or\ndisplays a respective number of muffins when pressing the muffin button. We use\nform states to disable the muffin button on invalid and non-number inputs, and\nwe also use it to display a specific error message in the case that too many\nmuffins are requested.\n\nWe disabled the button with the ```ng-disabled``` directive when our\nHTML5 number input field is invalid. We give the input field the name\n```muffinNumInput```. That name can then be referenced from the\n```muffinForm``` object in the scope as ```muffinForm.muffinNumInput```. Our\nnumber field dictates whether the form is invalid. If the input is not a\nnumber, is under the min, or over the max,\n```muffinForm.muffinNumInput.$invalid``` will be switched on.\n\nHowever, ```$invalid``` is general catch-all flag. If we want make use of more\ndetailed form states, we can make use of the ```$error``` attribute to see\nspecific error flags. In the example, we display an error message with the\n```ng-show``` directive when the number input field contains too large of a\nnumber. In that case, the ```max``` flag will be set and can be referenced by\n```muffinForm.muffinNumInput.$error.max```.\n\n<iframe src=\"/files/ng-book/examples/muffinbutton/index.html\"></iframe>\n\n### Styling the Form Based on Form State\n\nWe can style elements differently based on form states. It is nothing new, we\nsimply use form states in conjunction with ```ng-class```. With that, we can\ngive the number input element a red error border when the input is invalid and\ngreen when valid.\n\nAs a side thriller, we use ```$pristine``` to not apply these classes when the\nform has not been touched. The border color would then initially default to\ngray.\n\n    ::html\n    <input id=\"muffinNum\" type=\"number\" name=\"muffinNumInput\"\n           ng-model=\"muffinNum\" min=\"1\" max=\"255\"\n           ng-class=\"{'error': !muffinForm.$pristine && muffinForm.muffinNumInput.$invalid,\n                      'valid': !muffinForm.$pristine && !muffinForm.muffinNumInput.$invalid}\">\n\n## Up Next\n\nScopes, controllers, and templates lay the foundation of the cake.

Recall that the view, in the MVC pattern, generates the output\nrepresentation with assistance from the model.\n\nThe templates were designed, through the use of directives, to be more\ndeclarative for specifying UI. They are the standard, static DOM sprinkled with\nvarious Angular elements that add behavior to make the view more dynamic and\nmore closely binded with the model.\n\n---\n\nAngular seasons several different types of spices on top of standard HTML,\n\n- **expressions** that are evaluated JS-like code snippets placed in\n  bindings.\n- directives that augment existing DOM elements or represent a reusable\n  component.\n- **filters** that format or prettify data for display.\n- form controls that allow the user to input and allow the application to\n  validate data.\n\n## Angular Expressions\n\nAngular expressions are like inline JS snippets in the template,\nthough, following MVC, they are purposely limited in power. They are often\nplaced in bindings in the form of ```{{ expression }} ``` or in quotes for some\ndirectives.\n\nIn previous chapters, we have already been using expressions to evaluate\nproperties against scopes and to specify event handlers. They can also evaluate\nsimple mathematical and logical expressions. Example expressions might be\n\n- 1 + 1 * 42\n- someScopeAttr\n- someScopeAttr || someOtherScopeAttr\n- someScopeMethod()\n\nExpressions can also be separated by semicolons. A case where this would be\nuseful would be within the ```ngInit``` directive, where we could initialize\nmultiple properties on the scope.\n\n### Angular Expressions vs. Javascript Expressions\n\nAngular expressions are not simply ```eval()```ed JS expressions. Angular\nexpressions are like a subset of JS expressions. There are several notable\ndistinctions between the two. Angular\n\n- evaluates attributes against the scope, whereas JS would evaluate\n  against the global ```window```.\n- resolves errors and exceptions to ```undefined``` or ```null```,\n  whereas JS would throw an exception.\n- contains no control flow constructs such as conditionals or loops.\n\n### Example\n\nIn *An NBA Poem*, we will write a poem involving some basketball memes to\ndemonstrate Angular expressions.\n\n    ::html\n    <body ng-init=\"theDeludedOne = 'monta'; lebronRings = 0; bromance = true;\">\n    Not {{ lebronRings + 1 }}. Not {{ lebronRings + 2 }}. Not {{ lebronRings + 3 }}.\n\n    Because {{ theDeludedOne }} have it all.\n\n    {{ chris || 'Cliff' }} and {{ cliff || 'Chris' }} Paul, hoping for the championship.\n\n    While {{ bromance && 'Parsons' || 'Basketball' }} and Lin, a most delicate relationship.\n\nWith the scope property ```lebronRings``` initialized to \"0\", we can perform\nsimple addition such as in ```{{ lebronRings + 1 }}}``` to yield \"1\".\n\nOr we can simply output properties, as is, as a string. Such is the case where\n```{{ theDeludedOne }}``` evaluates to \"monta\".\n\nBecause expressions are forgiving, even though  ```chris``` has not been\ndefined, ```{{ chris || 'Cliff' }}``` still evaluates to \"Cliff\". Attempting to\nevaluate this expression in JS would raise a \"ReferenceError: chris is not\ndefined\", on the other hand.\n\nThe expression ```{{ chris || 'Cliff' }}``` also demonstrates the use of\nboolean logic to accomplish a simple conditional without any control flow\nconstructs. It evaluates ```chris``` if it exists, else it evalutes to \"Cliff\".\n\n#### Ternary Operations in Expressions\n\nOften in templates, an ```if then else``` kind of evaluation is useful. Angular\nexpressions do not contain any control flow constructs, however. Traditionally\nin JS, we could use an ```if then else``` flow.\n\n    ::js\n    if (a) {\n        return b;\n    } else {\n        return c;\n    }\n\nJS contains the ternary operator, to make it more succinct\n\n    ::js\n    return a ? b : c;\n\nAngular expressions do not contain the ternary operator. Equivalently, we can\nuse boolean logic to achieve the same control. In *An NBA Poem*, the expression\n```{{ bromance && 'Parsons' || 'Basketball }}``` demonstrates an\n```if then else``` evaluation. If ```bromance``` is not falsy, then the\nexpression evaluates to \"Parsons\", else it evaluates to \"Basketball\".\n\n## Built-in Directives\n\nDirectives teach HTML new tricks and allows us to forge reusable widgets.\nAlready, we have been using basic built-in Angular directives such as\n```ngApp```, ```ngModel```, ```ngController```, and ```ngClick```.\n\nBuilt-in directives can declared in all of several different styles, via\n\n- element: ```<directive></directive>```\n- attribute: ```<div directive=\"expression\"></div>```\n- class: ```<div class=\"directive = 'expression\"></div>```\n- comment: ```<!--directive: expression-->```\n\nWe will delve deeper into directives, and how to craft custom directives, in\n*Directives, Teaching an Old HTML New Tricks*.\n\nFor now, we will cover some useful directives that have not yet been covered.\nThe official Angular documentation contains an API reference detailing all of\nthe directives, totaling over 50 at time of writing.\n\n### ngClass\n\n```ngClass``` allows us to dynamically set CSS classes. We pass an expression\ncontaining class names that are either space-delimited, in an array, or in a\nmap that maps the classes to boolean values. Often, we use scope properties\nto conditionally determine whether a class is to be set.\n\nNote classes set with ```ngClass``` are *appended* to the classes normally set\nvia the HTML ```class``` attribute.\n\nOne way to register the directive is to pass ```expression``` into\n```ng-class```. The official Angular docmentation denotes expressions in\nbrackets when describing directive use, ```{expression}```, but note that it is\nfor annotation purposes. Expressions should **not** actually be surrounded in\nbrackets, unless we are passing a map which are coincidentally surrounded by\nbrackets.\n\n    ::html\n    <ANY ng-class=\"{expression}\">\n      ...\n    </ANY>\n\n#### Example\n\nIn *Transformer*, we will create checkboxes that will set classes to transform\nan HTML element to demonstrate ```ngClass```.\n\n    ::html\n    <div class=\"box\" ng-class=\"{'border': border, 'circle': circle, 'red': red,\n                                'rotate': rotate, 'scale': scale}\"></div>\n    <label for=\"rotate\">\n      <input id=\"rotate\" type=\"checkbox\" ng-model=\"rotate\">Rotate\n    </label>\n\nWe pass a mapping of classes to expressions. If the expressions are truthy,\nthen the class is set. For example, enabling the ```#rotate``` input will set\n```rotate``` to *true*. The \"rotate\" class will then be added to the\n```div``` on top of its \"box\" class.\n\n<iframe src=\"/files/ng-book/examples/transformer/index.html\"></iframe>\n\n#### Setting Classes on Specific Values\n\nWe can also conditionally set classes based on the specific value of a scope\nproperty with ```ngClass```. In *Transfomer*, pretend ```rotate```'s possible\nvalues are \"rotateSmall\", \"rotateMed\", and \"rotateLarge\". For each, we wish to\nset different classes.\n\n    ::html\n    <div class=\"box\" ng-class=\"{rotateSmall: 'rotateSmall red',\n                                rotateMed: 'rotateMed green'\n                                rotateLarge: 'rotateLarge blue'}[rotate]\"></div>\n\nInstead mapping from class names to boolean values, we can map from\nproperty values to class names. We use the scope property to fish the desired\nclasses. For example, if ```rotate``` is \"rotateSmall\", then the ```div``` will\nhave the classes \"rotateSmall\" and \"red\".\n\n### ngRepeat\n\n```ngRepeat``` is like a loop in the template. We can loop over an given array\nor map and generate a chunk of template on each iteration. Each instantiated\ntemplate is given its own scope, and each instantiated template is given access\nto temporary variables in context of the loop (e.g. ```$index```, ```$first```,\n```$last```). Often, ```ngRepeat``` is used to generate some sort of list\nview.\n\n    ::html\n    <ANY ng-repeat=\"{repeatExpression}\">\n      ...\n    </ANY>\n\n#### Example\n\nIn *Gym Leaders*, we will present a list of Pokemon gym leaders and their\nrespective Pokemon to demonstrate ```ngRepeat```.\n\n    ::js\n    $scope.gymLeaders = [\n        {name: 'Brock', pokemon: ['Geodude', 'Onyx']},\n        {name: 'Misty', pokemon: ['Staryu', 'Starmie']},\n        {name: 'Lt. Surge', pokemon: ['Voltorb', 'Magnemite', 'Raichu']},\n        // ...\n    ];\n\nThe ```gymLeaders``` data structure is an array of objects which we iterate\nthrough in the template. Note if ```gymLeaders``` is changed, Angular will\n```$apply``` the changes, updating the template.\n\n    ::html\n    <div ng-repeat=\"gymLeader in gymLeaders\">\n      <h2>{{ gymLeader.name }}</h2>\n      <span class=\"ngRepeat: pokemon in gymLeader.pokemon\">\n        {{ pokemon }}\n      </span>\n    </div>\n\nWe iterate over ```gymLeaders```. In a nested loop, we also iterate through\ntheir ```pokemon```. Each iteration copies the element with the ```ngRepeat```\ndirective along with whatever is within.\n\n*Template generated by an iteration of ng-repeat*\n\n    ::html\n    <div ng-repeat=\"gymLeader in gymLeaders\" class=\"ng-scope\">\n      <h2 class=\"ng-binding\">Brock</h2>\n      <!-- ngRepeat: pokemon in gymLeader.pokemon -->\n      <span class=\"ngRepeat: pokemon in gymLeader.pokemon ng-scope ng-binding\">\n        Geodude\n      </span>\n      <span class=\"ngRepeat: pokemon in gymLeader.pokemon ng-scope ng-binding\">\n        Onyx\n      </span>\n    </div>\n\n```ngRepeat``` can also iterate over JS objects, unpacking the keys and\nvalues. We could have defined ```gymLeaders``` using names of the gym leaders\nas keys.\n\n    ::js\n    $scope.gymLeaders = {\n        'Brock': ['Geodude', 'Onyx'],\n        'Misty': ['Staryu', 'Starmie'],\n        'Lt. Surge': ['Voltorb', 'Magnemite', 'Raichu'],\n        // ...\n    };\n\nWe could then iterate with ```ngRepeat```, although the order in which we\ndefined the gym leaders would not be preserved.\n\n    ::html\n    <div ng-repeat=\"(gymLeader, pokemon) in gymLeaders\">\n        // ...\n\n<iframe src=\"/files/ng-book/examples/gymleaders/index.html\"></iframe>\n\n### ngInclude\n\n```ngInclude``` allows us to fetch, compile, and embed an external HTML\nfragment or template. This inherits and creates a new scope. Often, we use\n```ngInclude``` to include HTML that we have abstracted into a **partial**, a\nseparate HTML template, for encapsulation or reusability.\n\n    ::html\n    <ANY ng-include=\"{srcString}\">\n      ...\n    </ANY>\n\nSince we are often including our own partial, ```srcString``` is usually a\nrelative path to the partial file. Note **cross-origin resource sharing**\n(CORS) restrictions still apply to included resources so the partial must be\nwithin the same domain.\n\n#### Example\n\nIn *Gym Leaders*, we will recycle our previous example and create a small\npartial to use within ```ng-repeat``` to demonstrate ```ng-include```.\n\n    ::html\n    <h2>{{ gymLeader.name }}</h2>\n    <span class=\"ngRepeat: pokemon in gymLeader.pokemon\">\n      {{ pokemon }}\n    </span>\n\nWe abstract the HTML from within our earlier ```ngRepeat``` loop into its\nown partial. When we include the partial, it inherit the scope so the data\nbindings will still evaluate properly.\n\n    ::html\n    <div ng-repeat=\"gymLeader in gymLeaders\">\n      <div ng-include=\"'partials/gym_leader.html'\"></div>\n    </div>\n\nThen we simply include our partial. The compiled HTML is identical to had we\nnot used a partial. Though now the main HTML file is somewhat cleaner, and we\ncould reuse our partial in other parts of the app if needed.\n\n## Filters\n\nAngular filters format or prettify data for display to the user. They can take\ncolon-delimited arguments and can also be chained.\n\n    ::js\n    {{ expression | firstFilter | secondFilter:arg1:arg2 }}\n\nAngular comes with a handful of handy filters built-in, all of which can be\nfound in the official Angular API reference.\n\n### Example\n\nIn *Hot Chat Phone Bill*, we will create a fake phone bill to demonstrate some\nbuilt-in Angular filters.\n\n    ::html\n    <dt>ID</dt> <dd>{{ 'oskpmknz' | uppercase }}</dd>\n    <dt>Date</dt> <dd>{{ billDate | date:'medium' }}</dd>\n    <dt>Charge Amount</dt> <dd>{{ 199.98 | currency }}</dd>\n\nThese filters highlight basic use. The ```uppercase``` filter simply transforms\na string to uppercase representation, no strings attached.\n\nFilters can also take argments. The ```date``` demonstrates such, taking a\nstring format describing how we want the date to be represented. \"medium\" is\na built-in choice by Angular.\n\n    ::html\n    <thead>\n      <tr>\n        <th ng-click=\"orderby = 'operator'; reverse = false\"><a>Operator</a></th>\n        <th ng-click=\"orderby = 'minutes'; reverse = true\"><a>Minutes</a></th>\n      </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody ng-init=\"orderby = 'minutes'; reverse = true\">\n      <tr ng-repeat=\"call in calls | orderBy:(orderby):reverse\">\n        <td>{{ call.operator }}</td>\n        <td>{{ call.minutes }}</td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n\nSome filters operate on arrays. ```orderBy``` sorts an array and can take in\nmultiple arguments. These arguments include what object properties to order by\nand whether to sort forwards or backwards.\n\nWe sort the call transactions either by the name of the operator or the minutes\nof the call. To mix it up, we make it a bit more dynamic, by changing the sort\nproperty and order upon clicking respective table headers.\n\n<iframe src=\"/files/ng-book/examples/hotchatphonebill/index.html\"></iframe>\n\n### Creating Custom Filters\n\nUse the Angular ```module```'s ```filter``` factory method to create and\nregister a custom filter. The method should take the name of the filter as the\nfirst argument and the filter function as the second argument.\n\nTo take arguments, the parameter function should return the filter function.\nThe filter function should take the input as the first argument. Additional\narguments can also be passed to the function.\n\n    ::js\n    angular.module('myModule', []).filter('myFilter', function() {\n        return function(input, arg) {\n            // Do something with input.\n            return input;\n        }\n    });\n\nThe filter can now be called in the template. Sorry, no hot chat examples for\ncustom filters.\n\n## Up Next\n\nSo now we got all this ability to manipulate and display data.

Attempting to\nevaluate this expression in JS would raise a \"ReferenceError: chris is not\ndefined\", on the other hand.\n\nThe expression ```{{ chris || 'Cliff' }}``` also demonstrates the use of\nboolean logic to accomplish a simple conditional without any control flow\nconstructs. It evaluates ```chris``` if it exists, else it evalutes to \"Cliff\".\n\n#### Ternary Operations in Expressions\n\nOften in templates, an ```if then else``` kind of evaluation is useful. Angular\nexpressions do not contain any control flow constructs, however. Traditionally\nin JS, we could use an ```if then else``` flow.\n\n    ::js\n    if (a) {\n        return b;\n    } else {\n        return c;\n    }\n\nJS contains the ternary operator, to make it more succinct\n\n    ::js\n    return a ? b : c;\n\nAngular expressions do not contain the ternary operator. Equivalently, we can\nuse boolean logic to achieve the same control. In *An NBA Poem*, the expression\n```{{ bromance && 'Parsons' || 'Basketball }}``` demonstrates an\n```if then else``` evaluation. If ```bromance``` is not falsy, then the\nexpression evaluates to \"Parsons\", else it evaluates to \"Basketball\".\n\n## Built-in Directives\n\nDirectives teach HTML new tricks and allows us to forge reusable widgets.\nAlready, we have been using basic built-in Angular directives such as\n```ngApp```, ```ngModel```, ```ngController```, and ```ngClick```.\n\nBuilt-in directives can declared in all of several different styles, via\n\n- element: ```<directive></directive>```\n- attribute: ```<div directive=\"expression\"></div>```\n- class: ```<div class=\"directive = 'expression\"></div>```\n- comment: ```<!--directive: expression-->```\n\nWe will delve deeper into directives, and how to craft custom directives, in\n*Directives, Teaching an Old HTML New Tricks*.\n\nFor now, we will cover some useful directives that have not yet been covered.\nThe official Angular documentation contains an API reference detailing all of\nthe directives, totaling over 50 at time of writing.\n\n### ngClass\n\n```ngClass``` allows us to dynamically set CSS classes. We pass an expression\ncontaining class names that are either space-delimited, in an array, or in a\nmap that maps the classes to boolean values. Often, we use scope properties\nto conditionally determine whether a class is to be set.\n\nNote classes set with ```ngClass``` are *appended* to the classes normally set\nvia the HTML ```class``` attribute.\n\nOne way to register the directive is to pass ```expression``` into\n```ng-class```. The official Angular docmentation denotes expressions in\nbrackets when describing directive use, ```{expression}```, but note that it is\nfor annotation purposes. Expressions should **not** actually be surrounded in\nbrackets, unless we are passing a map which are coincidentally surrounded by\nbrackets.\n\n    ::html\n    <ANY ng-class=\"{expression}\">\n      ...\n    </ANY>\n\n#### Example\n\nIn *Transformer*, we will create checkboxes that will set classes to transform\nan HTML element to demonstrate ```ngClass```.\n\n    ::html\n    <div class=\"box\" ng-class=\"{'border': border, 'circle': circle, 'red': red,\n                                'rotate': rotate, 'scale': scale}\"></div>\n    <label for=\"rotate\">\n      <input id=\"rotate\" type=\"checkbox\" ng-model=\"rotate\">Rotate\n    </label>\n\nWe pass a mapping of classes to expressions. If the expressions are truthy,\nthen the class is set. For example, enabling the ```#rotate``` input will set\n```rotate``` to *true*. The \"rotate\" class will then be added to the\n```div``` on top of its \"box\" class.\n\n<iframe src=\"/files/ng-book/examples/transformer/index.html\"></iframe>\n\n#### Setting Classes on Specific Values\n\nWe can also conditionally set classes based on the specific value of a scope\nproperty with ```ngClass```. In *Transfomer*, pretend ```rotate```'s possible\nvalues are \"rotateSmall\", \"rotateMed\", and \"rotateLarge\". For each, we wish to\nset different classes.\n\n    ::html\n    <div class=\"box\" ng-class=\"{rotateSmall: 'rotateSmall red',\n                                rotateMed: 'rotateMed green'\n                                rotateLarge: 'rotateLarge blue'}[rotate]\"></div>\n\nInstead mapping from class names to boolean values, we can map from\nproperty values to class names. We use the scope property to fish the desired\nclasses. For example, if ```rotate``` is \"rotateSmall\", then the ```div``` will\nhave the classes \"rotateSmall\" and \"red\".\n\n### ngRepeat\n\n```ngRepeat``` is like a loop in the template. We can loop over an given array\nor map and generate a chunk of template on each iteration. Each instantiated\ntemplate is given its own scope, and each instantiated template is given access\nto temporary variables in context of the loop (e.g. ```$index```, ```$first```,\n```$last```). Often, ```ngRepeat``` is used to generate some sort of list\nview.\n\n    ::html\n    <ANY ng-repeat=\"{repeatExpression}\">\n      ...\n    </ANY>\n\n#### Example\n\nIn *Gym Leaders*, we will present a list of Pokemon gym leaders and their\nrespective Pokemon to demonstrate ```ngRepeat```.\n\n    ::js\n    $scope.gymLeaders = [\n        {name: 'Brock', pokemon: ['Geodude', 'Onyx']},\n        {name: 'Misty', pokemon: ['Staryu', 'Starmie']},\n        {name: 'Lt. Surge', pokemon: ['Voltorb', 'Magnemite', 'Raichu']},\n        // ...\n    ];\n\nThe ```gymLeaders``` data structure is an array of objects which we iterate\nthrough in the template. Note if ```gymLeaders``` is changed, Angular will\n```$apply``` the changes, updating the template.\n\n    ::html\n    <div ng-repeat=\"gymLeader in gymLeaders\">\n      <h2>{{ gymLeader.name }}</h2>\n      <span class=\"ngRepeat: pokemon in gymLeader.pokemon\">\n        {{ pokemon }}\n      </span>\n    </div>\n\nWe iterate over ```gymLeaders```. In a nested loop, we also iterate through\ntheir ```pokemon```. Each iteration copies the element with the ```ngRepeat```\ndirective along with whatever is within.\n\n*Template generated by an iteration of ng-repeat*\n\n    ::html\n    <div ng-repeat=\"gymLeader in gymLeaders\" class=\"ng-scope\">\n      <h2 class=\"ng-binding\">Brock</h2>\n      <!-- ngRepeat: pokemon in gymLeader.pokemon -->\n      <span class=\"ngRepeat: pokemon in gymLeader.pokemon ng-scope ng-binding\">\n        Geodude\n      </span>\n      <span class=\"ngRepeat: pokemon in gymLeader.pokemon ng-scope ng-binding\">\n        Onyx\n      </span>\n    </div>\n\n```ngRepeat``` can also iterate over JS objects, unpacking the keys and\nvalues. We could have defined ```gymLeaders``` using names of the gym leaders\nas keys.\n\n    ::js\n    $scope.gymLeaders = {\n        'Brock': ['Geodude', 'Onyx'],\n        'Misty': ['Staryu', 'Starmie'],\n        'Lt. Surge': ['Voltorb', 'Magnemite', 'Raichu'],\n        // ...\n    };\n\nWe could then iterate with ```ngRepeat```, although the order in which we\ndefined the gym leaders would not be preserved.\n\n    ::html\n    <div ng-repeat=\"(gymLeader, pokemon) in gymLeaders\">\n        // ...\n\n<iframe src=\"/files/ng-book/examples/gymleaders/index.html\"></iframe>\n\n### ngInclude\n\n```ngInclude``` allows us to fetch, compile, and embed an external HTML\nfragment or template. This inherits and creates a new scope. Often, we use\n```ngInclude``` to include HTML that we have abstracted into a **partial**, a\nseparate HTML template, for encapsulation or reusability.\n\n    ::html\n    <ANY ng-include=\"{srcString}\">\n      ...\n    </ANY>\n\nSince we are often including our own partial, ```srcString``` is usually a\nrelative path to the partial file. Note **cross-origin resource sharing**\n(CORS) restrictions still apply to included resources so the partial must be\nwithin the same domain.\n\n#### Example\n\nIn *Gym Leaders*, we will recycle our previous example and create a small\npartial to use within ```ng-repeat``` to demonstrate ```ng-include```.\n\n    ::html\n    <h2>{{ gymLeader.name }}</h2>\n    <span class=\"ngRepeat: pokemon in gymLeader.pokemon\">\n      {{ pokemon }}\n    </span>\n\nWe abstract the HTML from within our earlier ```ngRepeat``` loop into its\nown partial. When we include the partial, it inherit the scope so the data\nbindings will still evaluate properly.\n\n    ::html\n    <div ng-repeat=\"gymLeader in gymLeaders\">\n      <div ng-include=\"'partials/gym_leader.html'\"></div>\n    </div>\n\nThen we simply include our partial. The compiled HTML is identical to had we\nnot used a partial. Though now the main HTML file is somewhat cleaner, and we\ncould reuse our partial in other parts of the app if needed.\n\n## Filters\n\nAngular filters format or prettify data for display to the user. They can take\ncolon-delimited arguments and can also be chained.\n\n    ::js\n    {{ expression | firstFilter | secondFilter:arg1:arg2 }}\n\nAngular comes with a handful of handy filters built-in, all of which can be\nfound in the official Angular API reference.\n\n### Example\n\nIn *Hot Chat Phone Bill*, we will create a fake phone bill to demonstrate some\nbuilt-in Angular filters.\n\n    ::html\n    <dt>ID</dt> <dd>{{ 'oskpmknz' | uppercase }}</dd>\n    <dt>Date</dt> <dd>{{ billDate | date:'medium' }}</dd>\n    <dt>Charge Amount</dt> <dd>{{ 199.98 | currency }}</dd>\n\nThese filters highlight basic use. The ```uppercase``` filter simply transforms\na string to uppercase representation, no strings attached.\n\nFilters can also take argments. The ```date``` demonstrates such, taking a\nstring format describing how we want the date to be represented. \"medium\" is\na built-in choice by Angular.\n\n    ::html\n    <thead>\n      <tr>\n        <th ng-click=\"orderby = 'operator'; reverse = false\"><a>Operator</a></th>\n        <th ng-click=\"orderby = 'minutes'; reverse = true\"><a>Minutes</a></th>\n      </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody ng-init=\"orderby = 'minutes'; reverse = true\">\n      <tr ng-repeat=\"call in calls | orderBy:(orderby):reverse\">\n        <td>{{ call.operator }}</td>\n        <td>{{ call.minutes }}</td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n\nSome filters operate on arrays. ```orderBy``` sorts an array and can take in\nmultiple arguments. These arguments include what object properties to order by\nand whether to sort forwards or backwards.\n\nWe sort the call transactions either by the name of the operator or the minutes\nof the call. To mix it up, we make it a bit more dynamic, by changing the sort\nproperty and order upon clicking respective table headers.\n\n<iframe src=\"/files/ng-book/examples/hotchatphonebill/index.html\"></iframe>\n\n### Creating Custom Filters\n\nUse the Angular ```module```'s ```filter``` factory method to create and\nregister a custom filter. The method should take the name of the filter as the\nfirst argument and the filter function as the second argument.\n\nTo take arguments, the parameter function should return the filter function.\nThe filter function should take the input as the first argument. Additional\narguments can also be passed to the function.\n\n    ::js\n    angular.module('myModule', []).filter('myFilter', function() {\n        return function(input, arg) {\n            // Do something with input.\n            return input;\n        }\n    });\n\nThe filter can now be called in the template. Sorry, no hot chat examples for\ncustom filters.\n\n## Up Next\n\nSo now we got all this ability to manipulate and display data. Let's take a\nquick step into [ch.5 Forms](/blog/angular-5), in which Angular provides\nfacilities for form validation and styling.\n","slug":"063_angular4","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-24T10:25:46.000Z","_id":"cj4b2m160005kgyi7ypjzo0ti","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","content":"<p>Angular <strong>templates</strong> are an enhanced specification of HTML that, along with\ninformation from the model, becomes the rendered view that the user sees in the\nbrowser.

class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">We will delve deeper into directives, and how to craft custom directives, in</div><div class=\"line\">*Directives, Teaching an Old HTML New Tricks*.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">For now, we will cover some useful directives that have not yet been covered.</div><div class=\"line\">The official Angular documentation contains an API reference detailing all of</div><div class=\"line\">the directives, totaling over 50 at time of writing.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">### ngClass</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">```ngClass``` allows us to dynamically set CSS classes. We pass an expression</div><div class=\"line\">containing class names that are either space-delimited, in an array, or in a</div><div class=\"line\">map that maps the classes to boolean values. Often, we use scope properties</div><div class=\"line\">to conditionally determine whether a class is to be set.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">Note classes set with ```ngClass``` are *appended* to the classes normally set</div><div class=\"line\">via the HTML ```class``` attribute.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">One way to register the directive is to pass ```expression``` into</div><div class=\"line\">```ng-class```. The official Angular docmentation denotes expressions in</div><div class=\"line\">brackets when describing directive use, ```&#123;expression&#125;```, but note that it is</div><div class=\"line\">for annotation purposes. Expressions should **not** actually be surrounded in</div><div class=\"line\">brackets, unless we are passing a map which are coincidentally surrounded by</div><div class=\"line\">brackets.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">    ::html</div><div class=\"line\">    &lt;ANY ng-class=&quot;&#123;expression&#125;&quot;&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">      ...</div><div class=\"line\">    &lt;/ANY&gt;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">#### Example</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">In *Transformer*, we will create checkboxes that will set classes to transform</div><div class=\"line\">an HTML element to demonstrate ```ngClass```.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">    ::html</div><div class=\"line\">    &lt;div class=&quot;box&quot; ng-class=&quot;&#123;&apos;border&apos;: border, &apos;circle&apos;: circle, &apos;red&apos;: red,</div><div class=\"line\">                                &apos;rotate&apos;: rotate, &apos;scale&apos;: scale&#125;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">    &lt;label for=&quot;rotate&quot;&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">      &lt;input id=&quot;rotate&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; ng-model=&quot;rotate&quot;&gt;Rotate</div><div class=\"line\">    &lt;/label&gt;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">We pass a mapping of classes to expressions. If the expressions are truthy,</div><div class=\"line\">then the class is set. For example, enabling the ```#rotate``` input will set</div><div class=\"line\">```rotate``` to *true*. The &quot;rotate&quot; class will then be added to the</div><div class=\"line\">```div``` on top of its &quot;box&quot; class.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">&lt;iframe src=&quot;/files/ng-book/examples/transformer/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">#### Setting Classes on Specific Values</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">We can also conditionally set classes based on the specific value of a scope</div><div class=\"line\">property with ```ngClass```. In *Transfomer*, pretend ```rotate```&apos;s possible</div><div class=\"line\">values are &quot;rotateSmall&quot;, &quot;rotateMed&quot;, and &quot;rotateLarge&quot;. For each, we wish to</div><div class=\"line\">set different classes.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">    ::html</div><div class=\"line\">    &lt;div class=&quot;box&quot; ng-class=&quot;&#123;rotateSmall: &apos;rotateSmall red&apos;,</div><div class=\"line\">                                rotateMed: &apos;rotateMed green&apos;</div><div class=\"line\">                                rotateLarge: &apos;rotateLarge blue&apos;&#125;[rotate]&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">Instead mapping from class names to boolean values, we can map from</div><div class=\"line\">property values to class names. We use the scope property to fish the desired</div><div class=\"line\">classes. For example, if ```rotate``` is &quot;rotateSmall&quot;, then the ```div``` will</div><div class=\"line\">have the classes &quot;rotateSmall&quot; and &quot;red&quot;.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">### ngRepeat</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">```ngRepeat``` is like a loop in the template. We can loop over an given array</div><div class=\"line\">or map and generate a chunk of template on each iteration. Each instantiated</div><div class=\"line\">template is given its own scope, and each instantiated template is given access</div><div class=\"line\">to temporary variables in context of the loop (e.g. ```$index```, ```$first```,</div><div class=\"line\">```$last```). Often, ```ngRepeat``` is used to generate some sort of list</div><div class=\"line\">view.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">    ::html</div><div class=\"line\">    &lt;ANY ng-repeat=&quot;&#123;repeatExpression&#125;&quot;&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">      ...</div><div class=\"line\">    &lt;/ANY&gt;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">#### Example</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">In *Gym Leaders*, we will present a list of Pokemon gym leaders and their</div><div class=\"line\">respective Pokemon to demonstrate ```ngRepeat```.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">    ::js</div><div class=\"line\">    $scope.gymLeaders = [</div><div class=\"line\">        &#123;name: &apos;Brock&apos;, pokemon: [&apos;Geodude&apos;, &apos;Onyx&apos;]&#125;,</div><div class=\"line\">        &#123;name: &apos;Misty&apos;, pokemon: [&apos;Staryu&apos;, &apos;Starmie&apos;]&#125;,</div><div class=\"line\">        &#123;name: &apos;Lt. Surge&apos;, pokemon: [&apos;Voltorb&apos;, &apos;Magnemite&apos;, &apos;Raichu&apos;]&#125;,</div><div class=\"line\">        // ...</div><div class=\"line\">    ];</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">The ```gymLeaders``` data structure is an array of objects which we iterate</div><div class=\"line\">through in the template. Note if ```gymLeaders``` is changed, Angular will</div><div class=\"line\">```$apply``` the changes, updating the template.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">    ::html</div><div class=\"line\">    &lt;div ng-repeat=&quot;gymLeader in gymLeaders&quot;&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">      &lt;h2&gt;&#123;&#123; gymLeader.name &#125;&#125;&lt;/h2&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">      &lt;span class=&quot;ngRepeat: pokemon in gymLeader.pokemon&quot;&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">        &#123;&#123; pokemon &#125;&#125;</div><div class=\"line\">      &lt;/span&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">    &lt;/div&gt;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">We iterate over ```gymLeaders```. In a nested loop, we also iterate through</div><div class=\"line\">their ```pokemon```. Each iteration copies the element with the ```ngRepeat</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>directive along with whatever is within.</p>\n<p><em>Template generated by an iteration of ng-repeat</em></p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;div ng-repeat=&quot;gymLeader in gymLeaders&quot; class=&quot;ng-scope&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;h2 class=&quot;ng-binding&quot;&gt;Brock&lt;/h2&gt;\n  &lt;!-- ngRepeat: pokemon in gymLeader.pokemon --&gt;\n  &lt;span class=&quot;ngRepeat: pokemon in gymLeader.pokemon ng-scope ng-binding&quot;&gt;\n    Geodude\n  &lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;span class=&quot;ngRepeat: pokemon in gymLeader.pokemon ng-scope ng-binding&quot;&gt;\n    Onyx\n  &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre><p><code>ngRepeat</code> can also iterate over JS objects, unpacking the keys and\nvalues. We could have defined <code>gymLeaders</code> using names of the gym leaders\nas keys.</p>\n<pre><code>::js\n$scope.gymLeaders = {\n    &apos;Brock&apos;: [&apos;Geodude&apos;, &apos;Onyx&apos;],\n    &apos;Misty&apos;: [&apos;Staryu&apos;, &apos;Starmie&apos;],\n    &apos;Lt. Surge&apos;: [&apos;Voltorb&apos;, &apos;Magnemite&apos;, &apos;Raichu&apos;],\n    // ...\n};\n</code></pre><p>We could then iterate with <code>ngRepeat</code>, although the order in which we\ndefined the gym leaders would not be preserved.</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;div ng-repeat=&quot;(gymLeader, pokemon) in gymLeaders&quot;&gt;\n    // ...\n</code></pre><iframe src=\"/files/ng-book/examples/gymleaders/index.html\"></iframe>\n\n<h3 id=\"ngInclude\"><a href=\"#ngInclude\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"ngInclude\"></a>ngInclude</h3><p><code>ngInclude</code> allows us to fetch, compile, and embed an external HTML\nfragment or template. This inherits and creates a new scope. Often, we use\n<code>ngInclude</code> to include HTML that we have abstracted into a <strong>partial</strong>, a\nseparate HTML template, for encapsulation or reusability.</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;ANY ng-include=&quot;{srcString}&quot;&gt;\n  ...\n&lt;/ANY&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Since we are often including our own partial, <code>srcString</code> is usually a\nrelative path to the partial file. Note <strong>cross-origin resource sharing</strong>\n(CORS) restrictions still apply to included resources so the partial must be\nwithin the same domain.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Example\"><a href=\"#Example\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Example\"></a>Example</h4><p>In <em>Gym Leaders</em>, we will recycle our previous example and create a small\npartial to use within <code>ng-repeat</code> to demonstrate <code>ng-include</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;h2&gt;{{ gymLeader.name }}&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;ngRepeat: pokemon in gymLeader.pokemon&quot;&gt;\n  {{ pokemon }}\n&lt;/span&gt;\n</code></pre><p>We abstract the HTML from within our earlier <code>ngRepeat</code> loop into its\nown partial. When we include the partial, it inherit the scope so the data\nbindings will still evaluate properly.</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;div ng-repeat=&quot;gymLeader in gymLeaders&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;div ng-include=&quot;&apos;partials/gym_leader.html&apos;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Then we simply include our partial. The compiled HTML is identical to had we\nnot used a partial. Though now the main HTML file is somewhat cleaner, and we\ncould reuse our partial in other parts of the app if needed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Filters\"><a href=\"#Filters\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Filters\"></a>Filters</h2><p>Angular filters format or prettify data for display to the user. They can take\ncolon-delimited arguments and can also be chained.</p>\n<pre><code>::js\n{{ expression | firstFilter | secondFilter:arg1:arg2 }}\n</code></pre><p>Angular comes with a handful of handy filters built-in, all of which can be\nfound in the official Angular API reference.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Example-1\"><a href=\"#Example-1\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Example\"></a>Example</h3><p>In <em>Hot Chat Phone Bill</em>, we will create a fake phone bill to demonstrate some\nbuilt-in Angular filters.</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;dt&gt;ID&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;{{ 'oskpmknz' | uppercase }}&lt;/dd&gt;\n&lt;dt&gt;Date&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;{{ billDate | date:'medium' }}&lt;/dd&gt;\n&lt;dt&gt;Charge Amount&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;{{ 199.98 | currency }}&lt;/dd&gt;\n</code></pre><p>These filters highlight basic use. The <code>uppercase</code> filter simply transforms\na string to uppercase representation, no strings attached.</p>\n<p>Filters can also take argments. The <code>date</code> demonstrates such, taking a\nstring format describing how we want the date to be represented. “medium” is\na built-in choice by Angular.</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;thead&gt;\n  &lt;tr&gt;\n    &lt;th ng-click=&quot;orderby = &apos;operator&apos;; reverse = false&quot;&gt;&lt;a&gt;Operator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;th ng-click=&quot;orderby = &apos;minutes&apos;; reverse = true&quot;&gt;&lt;a&gt;Minutes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n  &lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;\n&lt;tbody ng-init=&quot;orderby = &apos;minutes&apos;; reverse = true&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;tr ng-repeat=&quot;call in calls | orderBy:(orderby):reverse&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;{{ call.operator }}&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;{{ call.minutes }}&lt;/td&gt;\n  &lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Some filters operate on arrays. <code>orderBy</code> sorts an array and can take in\nmultiple arguments. These arguments include what object properties to order by\nand whether to sort forwards or backwards.</p>\n<p>We sort the call transactions either by the name of the operator or the minutes\nof the call. To mix it up, we make it a bit more dynamic, by changing the sort\nproperty and order upon clicking respective table headers.</p>\n<iframe src=\"/files/ng-book/examples/hotchatphonebill/index.html\"></iframe>\n\n<h3 id=\"Creating-Custom-Filters\"><a href=\"#Creating-Custom-Filters\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Creating Custom Filters\"></a>Creating Custom Filters</h3><p>Use the Angular <code>module</code>‘s <code>filter</code> factory method to create and\nregister a custom filter. The method should take the name of the filter as the\nfirst argument and the filter function as the second argument.</p>\n<p>To take arguments, the parameter function should return the filter function.\nThe filter function should take the input as the first argument. Additional\narguments can also be passed to the function.</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nangular.module(&apos;myModule&apos;, []).filter(&apos;myFilter&apos;, function() {\n    return function(input, arg) {\n        // Do something with input.\n        return input;\n    }\n});\n</code></pre><p>The filter can now be called in the template.

They can also evaluate</div><div class=\"line\">simple mathematical and logical expressions. Example expressions might be</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">- 1 + 1 * 42</div><div class=\"line\">- someScopeAttr</div><div class=\"line\">- someScopeAttr || someOtherScopeAttr</div><div class=\"line\">- someScopeMethod()</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">Expressions can also be separated by semicolons. A case where this would be</div><div class=\"line\">useful would be within the ```ngInit``` directive, where we could initialize</div><div class=\"line\">multiple properties on the scope.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">### Angular Expressions vs. Javascript Expressions</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">Angular expressions are not simply ```eval()```ed JS expressions. Angular</div><div class=\"line\">expressions are like a subset of JS expressions. There are several notable</div><div class=\"line\">distinctions between the two. Angular</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">- evaluates attributes against the scope, whereas JS would evaluate</div><div class=\"line\">  against the global ```window```.</div><div class=\"line\">- resolves errors and exceptions to ```undefined``` or ```null```,</div><div class=\"line\">  whereas JS would throw an exception.</div><div class=\"line\">- contains no control flow constructs such as conditionals or loops.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">### Example</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">In *An NBA Poem*, we will write a poem involving some basketball memes to</div><div class=\"line\">demonstrate Angular expressions.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">    ::html</div><div class=\"line\">    &lt;body ng-init=&quot;theDeludedOne = &apos;monta&apos;; lebronRings = 0; bromance = true;&quot;&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">    Not &#123;&#123; lebronRings + 1 &#125;&#125;. Not &#123;&#123; lebronRings + 2 &#125;&#125;. Not &#123;&#123; lebronRings + 3 &#125;&#125;.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">    Because &#123;&#123; theDeludedOne &#125;&#125; have it all.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">    &#123;&#123; chris || &apos;Cliff&apos; &#125;&#125; and &#123;&#123; cliff || &apos;Chris&apos; &#125;&#125; Paul, hoping for the championship.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">    While &#123;&#123; bromance &amp;&amp; &apos;Parsons&apos; || &apos;Basketball&apos; &#125;&#125; and Lin, a most delicate relationship.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">With the scope property ```lebronRings``` initialized to &quot;0&quot;, we can perform</div><div class=\"line\">simple addition such as in ```&#123;&#123; lebronRings + 1 &#125;&#125;&#125;``` to yield &quot;1&quot;.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">Or we can simply output properties, as is, as a string. Such is the case where</div><div class=\"line\">```&#123;&#123; theDeludedOne &#125;&#125;``` evaluates to &quot;monta&quot;.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">Because expressions are forgiving, even though  ```chris``` has not been</div><div class=\"line\">defined, ```&#123;&#123; chris || &apos;Cliff&apos; &#125;&#125;``` still evaluates to &quot;Cliff&quot;. Attempting to</div><div class=\"line\">evaluate this expression in JS would raise a &quot;ReferenceError: chris is not</div><div class=\"line\">defined&quot;, on the other hand.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">The expression ```&#123;&#123; chris || &apos;Cliff&apos; &#125;&#125;``` also demonstrates the use of</div><div class=\"line\">boolean logic to accomplish a simple conditional without any control flow</div><div class=\"line\">constructs. It evaluates ```chris``` if it exists, else it evalutes to &quot;Cliff&quot;.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">#### Ternary Operations in Expressions</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">Often in templates, an ```if then else``` kind of evaluation is useful. Angular</div><div class=\"line\">expressions do not contain any control flow constructs, however. Traditionally</div><div class=\"line\">in JS, we could use an ```if then else``` flow.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">    ::js</div><div class=\"line\">    if (a) &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">        return b;</div><div class=\"line\">    &#125; else &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">        return c;</div><div class=\"line\">    &#125;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">JS contains the ternary operator, to make it more succinct</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">    ::js</div><div class=\"line\">    return a ? b : c;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">Angular expressions do not contain the ternary operator. Equivalently, we can</div><div class=\"line\">use boolean logic to achieve the same control. In *An NBA Poem*, the expression</div><div class=\"line\">```&#123;&#123; bromance &amp;&amp; &apos;Parsons&apos; || &apos;Basketball &#125;&#125;``` demonstrates an</div><div class=\"line\">```if then else``` evaluation. If ```bromance``` is not falsy, then the</div><div class=\"line\">expression evaluates to &quot;Parsons&quot;, else it evaluates to &quot;Basketball&quot;.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">## Built-in Directives</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">Directives teach HTML new tricks and allows us to forge reusable widgets.</div><div class=\"line\">Already, we

class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">We will delve deeper into directives, and how to craft custom directives, in</div><div class=\"line\">*Directives, Teaching an Old HTML New Tricks*.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">For now, we will cover some useful directives that have not yet been covered.</div><div class=\"line\">The official Angular documentation contains an API reference detailing all of</div><div class=\"line\">the directives, totaling over 50 at time of writing.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">### ngClass</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">```ngClass``` allows us to dynamically set CSS classes. We pass an expression</div><div class=\"line\">containing class names that are either space-delimited, in an array, or in a</div><div class=\"line\">map that maps the classes to boolean values. Often, we use scope properties</div><div class=\"line\">to conditionally determine whether a class is to be set.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">Note classes set with ```ngClass``` are *appended* to the classes normally set</div><div class=\"line\">via the HTML ```class``` attribute.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">One way to register the directive is to pass ```expression``` into</div><div class=\"line\">```ng-class```. The official Angular docmentation denotes expressions in</div><div class=\"line\">brackets when describing directive use, ```&#123;expression&#125;```, but note that it is</div><div class=\"line\">for annotation purposes. Expressions should **not** actually be surrounded in</div><div class=\"line\">brackets, unless we are passing a map which are coincidentally surrounded by</div><div class=\"line\">brackets.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">    ::html</div><div class=\"line\">    &lt;ANY ng-class=&quot;&#123;expression&#125;&quot;&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">      ...</div><div class=\"line\">    &lt;/ANY&gt;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">#### Example</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">In *Transformer*, we will create checkboxes that will set classes to transform</div><div class=\"line\">an HTML element to demonstrate ```ngClass```.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">    ::html</div><div class=\"line\">    &lt;div class=&quot;box&quot; ng-class=&quot;&#123;&apos;border&apos;: border, &apos;circle&apos;: circle, &apos;red&apos;: red,</div><div class=\"line\">                                &apos;rotate&apos;: rotate, &apos;scale&apos;: scale&#125;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">    &lt;label for=&quot;rotate&quot;&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">      &lt;input id=&quot;rotate&quot; type=&quot;checkbox&quot; ng-model=&quot;rotate&quot;&gt;Rotate</div><div class=\"line\">    &lt;/label&gt;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">We pass a mapping of classes to expressions. If the expressions are truthy,</div><div class=\"line\">then the class is set. For example, enabling the ```#rotate``` input will set</div><div class=\"line\">```rotate``` to *true*. The &quot;rotate&quot; class will then be added to the</div><div class=\"line\">```div``` on top of its &quot;box&quot; class.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">&lt;iframe src=&quot;/files/ng-book/examples/transformer/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">#### Setting Classes on Specific Values</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">We can also conditionally set classes based on the specific value of a scope</div><div class=\"line\">property with ```ngClass```. In *Transfomer*, pretend ```rotate```&apos;s possible</div><div class=\"line\">values are &quot;rotateSmall&quot;, &quot;rotateMed&quot;, and &quot;rotateLarge&quot;. For each, we wish to</div><div class=\"line\">set different classes.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">    ::html</div><div class=\"line\">    &lt;div class=&quot;box&quot; ng-class=&quot;&#123;rotateSmall: &apos;rotateSmall red&apos;,</div><div class=\"line\">                                rotateMed: &apos;rotateMed green&apos;</div><div class=\"line\">                                rotateLarge: &apos;rotateLarge blue&apos;&#125;[rotate]&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">Instead mapping from class names to boolean values, we can map from</div><div class=\"line\">property values to class names. We use the scope property to fish the desired</div><div class=\"line\">classes. For example, if ```rotate``` is &quot;rotateSmall&quot;, then the ```div``` will</div><div class=\"line\">have the classes &quot;rotateSmall&quot; and &quot;red&quot;.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">### ngRepeat</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">```ngRepeat``` is like a loop in the template. We can loop over an given array</div><div class=\"line\">or map and generate a chunk of template on each iteration. Each instantiated</div><div class=\"line\">template is given its own scope, and each instantiated template is given access</div><div class=\"line\">to temporary variables in context of the loop (e.g. ```$index```, ```$first```,</div><div class=\"line\">```$last```). Often, ```ngRepeat``` is used to generate some sort of list</div><div class=\"line\">view.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">    ::html</div><div class=\"line\">    &lt;ANY ng-repeat=&quot;&#123;repeatExpression&#125;&quot;&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">      ...</div><div class=\"line\">    &lt;/ANY&gt;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">#### Example</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">In *Gym Leaders*, we will present a list of Pokemon gym leaders and their</div><div class=\"line\">respective Pokemon to demonstrate ```ngRepeat```.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">    ::js</div><div class=\"line\">    $scope.gymLeaders = [</div><div class=\"line\">        &#123;name: &apos;Brock&apos;, pokemon: [&apos;Geodude&apos;, &apos;Onyx&apos;]&#125;,</div><div class=\"line\">        &#123;name: &apos;Misty&apos;, pokemon: [&apos;Staryu&apos;, &apos;Starmie&apos;]&#125;,</div><div class=\"line\">        &#123;name: &apos;Lt. Surge&apos;, pokemon: [&apos;Voltorb&apos;, &apos;Magnemite&apos;, &apos;Raichu&apos;]&#125;,</div><div class=\"line\">        // ...</div><div class=\"line\">    ];</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">The ```gymLeaders``` data structure is an array of objects which we iterate</div><div class=\"line\">through in the template. Note if ```gymLeaders``` is changed, Angular will</div><div class=\"line\">```$apply``` the changes, updating the template.</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">    ::html</div><div class=\"line\">    &lt;div ng-repeat=&quot;gymLeader in gymLeaders&quot;&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">      &lt;h2&gt;&#123;&#123; gymLeader.name &#125;&#125;&lt;/h2&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">      &lt;span class=&quot;ngRepeat: pokemon in gymLeader.pokemon&quot;&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">        &#123;&#123; pokemon &#125;&#125;</div><div class=\"line\">      &lt;/span&gt;</div><div class=\"line\">    &lt;/div&gt;</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">We iterate over ```gymLeaders```. In a nested loop, we also iterate through</div><div class=\"line\">their ```pokemon```. Each iteration copies the element with the ```ngRepeat</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>directive along with whatever is within.</p>\n<p><em>Template generated by an iteration of ng-repeat</em></p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;div ng-repeat=&quot;gymLeader in gymLeaders&quot; class=&quot;ng-scope&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;h2 class=&quot;ng-binding&quot;&gt;Brock&lt;/h2&gt;\n  &lt;!-- ngRepeat: pokemon in gymLeader.pokemon --&gt;\n  &lt;span class=&quot;ngRepeat: pokemon in gymLeader.pokemon ng-scope ng-binding&quot;&gt;\n    Geodude\n  &lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;span class=&quot;ngRepeat: pokemon in gymLeader.pokemon ng-scope ng-binding&quot;&gt;\n    Onyx\n  &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre><p><code>ngRepeat</code> can also iterate over JS objects, unpacking the keys and\nvalues. We could have defined <code>gymLeaders</code> using names of the gym leaders\nas keys.</p>\n<pre><code>::js\n$scope.gymLeaders = {\n    &apos;Brock&apos;: [&apos;Geodude&apos;, &apos;Onyx&apos;],\n    &apos;Misty&apos;: [&apos;Staryu&apos;, &apos;Starmie&apos;],\n    &apos;Lt. Surge&apos;: [&apos;Voltorb&apos;, &apos;Magnemite&apos;, &apos;Raichu&apos;],\n    // ...\n};\n</code></pre><p>We could then iterate with <code>ngRepeat</code>, although the order in which we\ndefined the gym leaders would not be preserved.</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;div ng-repeat=&quot;(gymLeader, pokemon) in gymLeaders&quot;&gt;\n    // ...\n</code></pre><iframe src=\"/files/ng-book/examples/gymleaders/index.html\"></iframe>\n\n<h3 id=\"ngInclude\"><a href=\"#ngInclude\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"ngInclude\"></a>ngInclude</h3><p><code>ngInclude</code> allows us to fetch, compile, and embed an external HTML\nfragment or template. This inherits and creates a new scope. Often, we use\n<code>ngInclude</code> to include HTML that we have abstracted into a <strong>partial</strong>, a\nseparate HTML template, for encapsulation or reusability.</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;ANY ng-include=&quot;{srcString}&quot;&gt;\n  ...\n&lt;/ANY&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Since we are often including our own partial, <code>srcString</code> is usually a\nrelative path to the partial file. Note <strong>cross-origin resource sharing</strong>\n(CORS) restrictions still apply to included resources so the partial must be\nwithin the same domain.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Example\"><a href=\"#Example\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Example\"></a>Example</h4><p>In <em>Gym Leaders</em>, we will recycle our previous example and create a small\npartial to use within <code>ng-repeat</code> to demonstrate <code>ng-include</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;h2&gt;{{ gymLeader.name }}&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;ngRepeat: pokemon in gymLeader.pokemon&quot;&gt;\n  {{ pokemon }}\n&lt;/span&gt;\n</code></pre><p>We abstract the HTML from within our earlier <code>ngRepeat</code> loop into its\nown partial. When we include the partial, it inherit the scope so the data\nbindings will still evaluate properly.</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;div ng-repeat=&quot;gymLeader in gymLeaders&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;div ng-include=&quot;&apos;partials/gym_leader.html&apos;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Then we simply include our partial. The compiled HTML is identical to had we\nnot used a partial. Though now the main HTML file is somewhat cleaner, and we\ncould reuse our partial in other parts of the app if needed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Filters\"><a href=\"#Filters\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Filters\"></a>Filters</h2><p>Angular filters format or prettify data for display to the user. They can take\ncolon-delimited arguments and can also be chained.</p>\n<pre><code>::js\n{{ expression | firstFilter | secondFilter:arg1:arg2 }}\n</code></pre><p>Angular comes with a handful of handy filters built-in, all of which can be\nfound in the official Angular API reference.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Example-1\"><a href=\"#Example-1\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Example\"></a>Example</h3><p>In <em>Hot Chat Phone Bill</em>, we will create a fake phone bill to demonstrate some\nbuilt-in Angular filters.</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;dt&gt;ID&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;{{ 'oskpmknz' | uppercase }}&lt;/dd&gt;\n&lt;dt&gt;Date&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;{{ billDate | date:'medium' }}&lt;/dd&gt;\n&lt;dt&gt;Charge Amount&lt;/dt&gt; &lt;dd&gt;{{ 199.98 | currency }}&lt;/dd&gt;\n</code></pre><p>These filters highlight basic use. The <code>uppercase</code> filter simply transforms\na string to uppercase representation, no strings attached.</p>\n<p>Filters can also take argments. The <code>date</code> demonstrates such, taking a\nstring format describing how we want the date to be represented. “medium” is\na built-in choice by Angular.</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;thead&gt;\n  &lt;tr&gt;\n    &lt;th ng-click=&quot;orderby = &apos;operator&apos;; reverse = false&quot;&gt;&lt;a&gt;Operator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;th ng-click=&quot;orderby = &apos;minutes&apos;; reverse = true&quot;&gt;&lt;a&gt;Minutes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n  &lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;\n&lt;tbody ng-init=&quot;orderby = &apos;minutes&apos;; reverse = true&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;tr ng-repeat=&quot;call in calls | orderBy:(orderby):reverse&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;{{ call.operator }}&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;{{ call.minutes }}&lt;/td&gt;\n  &lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Some filters operate on arrays. <code>orderBy</code> sorts an array and can take in\nmultiple arguments. These arguments include what object properties to order by\nand whether to sort forwards or backwards.</p>\n<p>We sort the call transactions either by the name of the operator or the minutes\nof the call. To mix it up, we make it a bit more dynamic, by changing the sort\nproperty and order upon clicking respective table headers.</p>\n<iframe src=\"/files/ng-book/examples/hotchatphonebill/index.html\"></iframe>\n\n<h3 id=\"Creating-Custom-Filters\"><a href=\"#Creating-Custom-Filters\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Creating Custom Filters\"></a>Creating Custom Filters</h3><p>Use the Angular <code>module</code>‘s <code>filter</code> factory method to create and\nregister a custom filter. The method should take the name of the filter as the\nfirst argument and the filter function as the second argument.</p>\n<p>To take arguments, the parameter function should return the filter function.\nThe filter function should take the input as the first argument. Additional\narguments can also be passed to the function.</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nangular.module(&apos;myModule&apos;, []).filter(&apos;myFilter&apos;, function() {\n    return function(input, arg) {\n        // Do something with input.\n        return input;\n    }\n});\n</code></pre><p>The filter can now be called in the template. Sorry, no hot chat examples for\ncustom filters.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Up-Next\"><a href=\"#Up-Next\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Up Next\"></a>Up Next</h2><p>So now we got all this ability to manipulate and display data.

Rather than relying on\nnatural light, using strobes puts the whole scene under your control. It's more\nmeticulous, but the results are beyond reach of a natural light snapshot.\n\n---\n\nI've read a bit of [David Hobby's\nStrobist](http://strobist.blogspot.com/2006/03/lighting-101.html), the de-facto\nguide for making use of off-camera flashes. There are several ways to trigger\nan off-camera flash. I use radio triggers. The [CowboyStudio\nNPT-04](http://www.amazon.com/CowboyStudio-NPT-04-Channel-Wireless-Receiver/dp/B002W3IXZW)\nis a ridiculously cheap, but nails, trigger. Place the trigger on the hotshoe,\nand attach the receivers to the flashes. Make sure your camera is on manual and\nyour shutter speed is below the maximum flash sync speed. It's also nice to a\nflash capable of manual operation (to set power).\n\nA good workflow for getting a scene set up is to:\n\n- Start without any flashes. Lower camera exposure as much as possible while\n  still keeping all detail and legibility in the image. We start with an\n  underexposed image, and paint the light on.\n- Add one flash at a time, illuminating what you wish to illuminate.\n- Through trial-and-error (it gets faster over time), tweak camera exposure\n  and flash power until the scene is lit as desired.\n\n## Example 1: The Dimly-Lit Garage\n\nNormally, when I'm indoors, I like to bounce the flash off the ceiling for a\nnice even swath of light. But there's less dimension and it's a one-pony\ntechnique. So let's first start *without any flashes*:\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/g0vQnVy.jpg)\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nIt was dark, so they de-strobed.\n</span></div>\n\nIt's...dark. But no worries, a lot of the detail is still legible. We see the\nentire model (even the dark right hand), and details in the background. I'm\nshooting RAW so I still have a lot of dynamic range, and we'll layer in light\nin the next step. Let's add *one strobe*:\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/whJYX1M.jpg)\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nA bit out-of-focus since I was using a manual lens, but the light is there.\n</span></div>\n\nWe now have a strobe on camera right. It's pointed 45-degrees towards the\nsubject from camera right. This one isn't manual so I'm forced to use it at\nfull power, but it is not too overpowering. Since it's only one flash from one\nside, we see a lot of dimension on the model with the shadows on camera left.\n\nHowever, too much dimension can sometimes not be flattering. We see lot of the\nmodel's wrinkles (hadn't had her beauty sleep). We can flatten the lighting by\nadding yet *another strobe*:\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/J7eVG0f.jpg)\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nA perfect white complexion.\n</span></div>\n\nAnd we have a nice even studio lighting. This strobe is set up on 45-degrees\ncamera left pointed towards the subject. This set up of two strobes behind the\ncamera each pointed 45-degrees toward the subject is fairly common to achieve\neven lighting. Here's a rough photo of the setup (one strobe on the left,\none strobe within the shelves):\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/wbwCOzP.jpg)\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nLighting setup.\n</span></div>\n\n## Example 2: Out At Dusk\n\nI took it outside to the backyard. The sun was done, so no hope for golden\nhour, but as strobie-doos, we don't need no sun. We can make our own sun. I\nplaced our model, Chicken, in front of the garden on a little wooden stool.\nThen *one flash* for a sidelight fill on camera left:\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ysrUcRC.jpg)\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nThe ol' Chicken in the headlights.\n</span></div>\n\nWith one flash, it doesn't quick look natural, though it makes for a cool\nscene. I imagine Chicken waiting at home for her husband on the porch, and the\nheadlights slowly rearing in towards her. So our model is now pretty well lit,\nbut the background leaves something to be desired. We can creatively use our\n*second flash* to accent the background!\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ORNBKr1.jpg)\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nManufacturing our own golden hour.\n</span></div>\n\nIt looks like sunrise! I actually had to manually hold the flash pointing down\n45-degrees on camera right towards the plants, while setting a 12-second timer\non the manually-focused camera. It's times like these where a stand to hold the\nflash would come in handy. The second flash created a nice warm swath of light,\noverpowering the first flash to create a sense that the sun is on camera right.\n\n## From Here\n\nOff-camera lighting gives complete dictatorship over the lighting of the scene.\nIt can make night into day, or add an extremely dramatic punch. With no strobe\nor on-camera flash, you are forced to make do with what you have with little\nchoice. With multiple flashes, lighting modifiers (umbrellas, boxes), there are\nno limits.\n\n*Photos taken with Pentax K-30 w/ Pentax-M 50mm f1.7.*\n","source":"_posts/069_twostrobe.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"Off-Camera Lighting with Two Strobes\"\ntype: blog\ncategory: blog\ndate: 2014-07-28\nid: two-strobes\ntags: [photography]\n\nimage:\n    url: http://i.imgur.com/IMscjuR.jpg\n    caption: Had to grab my dad's Canon SL1, my old nifty-fifty, and install proprietary Canon RAW support for this measly shot.\n---\n\nOne muggy evening in a dimly-lit garage.

It’s also nice to a\nflash capable of manual operation (to set power).</p>\n<p>A good workflow for getting a scene set up is to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start without any flashes. Lower camera exposure as much as possible while\nstill keeping all detail and legibility in the image. We start with an\nunderexposed image, and paint the light on.</li>\n<li>Add one flash at a time, illuminating what you wish to illuminate.</li>\n<li>Through trial-and-error (it gets faster over time), tweak camera exposure\nand flash power until the scene is lit as desired.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Example-1-The-Dimly-Lit-Garage\"><a href=\"#Example-1-The-Dimly-Lit-Garage\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Example 1: The Dimly-Lit Garage\"></a>Example 1: The Dimly-Lit Garage</h2><p>Normally, when I’m indoors, I like to bounce the flash off the ceiling for a\nnice even swath of light. But there’s less dimension and it’s a one-pony\ntechnique. So let’s first start <em>without any flashes</em>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/g0vQnVy.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nIt was dark, so they de-strobed.\n</span></div>\n\n<p>It’s…dark. But no worries, a lot of the detail is still legible. We see the\nentire model (even the dark right hand), and details in the background. I’m\nshooting RAW so I still have a lot of dynamic range, and we’ll layer in light\nin the next step. Let’s add <em>one strobe</em>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/whJYX1M.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nA bit out-of-focus since I was using a manual lens, but the light is there.\n</span></div>\n\n<p>We now have a strobe on camera right. It’s pointed 45-degrees towards the\nsubject from camera right. This one isn’t manual so I’m forced to use it at\nfull power, but it is not too overpowering. Since it’s only one flash from one\nside, we see a lot of dimension on the model with the shadows on camera left.</p>\n<p>However, too much dimension can sometimes not be flattering. We see lot of the\nmodel’s wrinkles (hadn’t had her beauty sleep). We can flatten the lighting by\nadding yet <em>another strobe</em>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/J7eVG0f.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nA perfect white complexion.\n</span></div>\n\n<p>And we have a nice even studio lighting. This strobe is set up on 45-degrees\ncamera left pointed towards the subject. This set up of two strobes behind the\ncamera each pointed 45-degrees toward the subject is fairly common to achieve\neven lighting. Here’s a rough photo of the setup (one strobe on the left,\none strobe within the shelves):</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/wbwCOzP.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nLighting setup.\n</span></div>\n\n<h2 id=\"Example-2-Out-At-Dusk\"><a href=\"#Example-2-Out-At-Dusk\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Example 2: Out At Dusk\"></a>Example 2: Out At Dusk</h2><p>I took it outside to the backyard. The sun was done, so no hope for golden\nhour, but as strobie-doos, we don’t need no sun. We can make our own sun. I\nplaced our model, Chicken, in front of the garden on a little wooden stool.\nThen <em>one flash</em> for a sidelight fill on camera left:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ysrUcRC.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nThe ol’ Chicken in the headlights.\n</span></div>\n\n<p>With one flash, it doesn’t quick look natural, though it makes for a cool\nscene. I imagine Chicken waiting at home for her husband on the porch, and the\nheadlights slowly rearing in towards her. So our model is now pretty well lit,\nbut the background leaves something to be desired. We can creatively use our\n<em>second flash</em> to accent the background!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ORNBKr1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nManufacturing our own golden hour.\n</span></div>\n\n<p>It looks like sunrise! I actually had to manually hold the flash pointing down\n45-degrees on camera right towards the plants, while setting a 12-second timer\non the manually-focused camera. It’s times like these where a stand to hold the\nflash would come in handy. The second flash created a nice warm swath of light,\noverpowering the first flash to create a sense that the sun is on camera right.</p>\n<h2 id=\"From-Here\"><a href=\"#From-Here\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"From Here\"></a>From Here</h2><p>Off-camera lighting gives complete dictatorship over the lighting of the scene.\nIt can make night into day, or add an extremely dramatic punch. With no strobe\nor on-camera flash, you are forced to make do with what you have with little\nchoice. With multiple flashes, lighting modifiers (umbrellas, boxes), there are\nno limits.</p>\n<p><em>Photos taken with Pentax K-30 w/ Pentax-M 50mm f1.7.</em></p>\n"},{"title":"Browserify and Gulp Workflow for React","type":"blog","date":"2014-07-30T07:00:00.000Z","id":"react-browserify-gulp","_content":"\nThe JS world moves quickly. New web tools are adopted faster than new\nSpidermans (men?) are produced. One second, people are talking about AngularJS,\nRequireJS, and Grunt. The next, it's React, Browserify, and Gulp. Who knows, by\ntomorrow we could have some new shiny things called McRib, Modulus, or Chug.\nBut the new workflows that come along never fail to keep development\ninteresting and never fail to make our lives easier. Kay, it's time to freshen\nup. Let us answer: what is so streets-ahead about these new web technologies?\n\n---\n\nTo talk about Browserify and Gulp, we'd need to take a look at their siblings.\n\n- RequireJS is a JS module loader that manages dependencies. Very rough idea\n  would be like having Python ```imports``` in JS.\n- Grunt is a JS task runner. A common use is the automation of builds of\n  frontend codebases (i.e., JS minification, bundling, CSS pre-compilation).\n  Very rough idea would be to think of it as a JS Makefile.\n\nLet's explore what the new kids on the block are kicking around.\n\n## Why React?\n\nReact is a JS library for building reusuable components.  These components do\nnot require you to manually set up linking functions or any data binding. Just\ncall ```render``` and it will refresh in the DOM. React even diffs refreshes to\nthe DOM to minimize unnecessary re-rendering for very performant view\nrendering.\n\nNote that React is not a full MVC framework. As such, It makes a nice wine\npairing with other frameworks. I won't fully dive into React code today, but we\ncan get a nice workflow set up specifically for it.\n\n## Why Browserify?\n\nTo pull in a third-party dependency in RequireJS, one must venture out into the\ninternet and curl/wget/download/whatever the file into their project. Then they\ncan ```require```d. Any updates will have to be refetched manually Repeat this\nwith multiple dependencies for multiple projects, and it becomes a nuisance.\nHaving to optimize RequireJS projects in another step is a rotten cherry on\ntop.\n\nBrowserify piggybacks ```npm```. Dependencies with Browserify support such as\njQuery, Underscore.js, React, or AngularJS can be hosted on ```npm```,\nspecified and listed all in ```package.json```, and Browserify will handle the\nbundling of these dependencies with your source code into a single file for\nyou! Browserify even creates a dependency tree to figure out which modules\nneed and need not to be included in the bundle. Smart lad.\n\n## Why Gulp?\n\nGulp consist more of code whereas Grunt are structured more towards\nconfiguration. It can be a matter of preference, but Gulp's focus on chained\npipelines and streams make it such that intermediary data or files are not\nneeded when handling things such as minification and pre-compilation.\n\nGrunt is well-fleshed with its thousands plugins from the community. However,\nGulp is getting there. In the short dip I've taken, Gulp had more than all the\nplugins I needed. Either way, you'll be well supported.\n\nHere's my project's gulpfile. It uses ```reactify``` to precompile React JSX\nfiles into normal JS files which is then pipelined to ```browserify``` for\nbundling with dependencies. It compiles Stylus files to CSS. And everything's\nnicely set up to watch directories and rebuild when needed.

There are 8 players left. I have an\nabove average size stack about 8 times the the size of the pot (M=8). I'm\nin early position, UTG+1, with JJ. I raise ~2.2x. It folds around to the BB.\nThe BB is the chipleader, a southern guy who isn't much of a thinker. I just\nsaw him 3bet shove over a shortstack with 99, and raise/call with KQo. He 3bet\nshoves, putting me all in.\n\nAfter a few seconds of thinking, I called. I was getting **2.2:1 odds on my\ncall** (call 34k to win 71k), and guessed that it was good. I was willing to\ntake the variance hit in order to secure a chip lead to take down the\ntournament. Trying to learn how to risk a probable cash-out to make a go for\nfirst place (reduce the ITM% to increase the ROI%). I said that I guessed 2.2:1\nodds was good against his shoving range, so let's do the math and see if that\nchecks out.\n\n---\n\n## Tallying up Combos\n\nFirst, we ask. What range is he shoving? Not much. I'd wager as a conservative\nestimate: **{TT+, AQ+}**. Let's break the range down combinatorically:\n\n- 6 combos of TT\n- 1 combo of JJ\n- 6 combos of QQ\n- 6 combos of KK\n- 6 combos of AA\n- 16 combos of AQ\n- 16 combos of AK\n\nLet's ignore JJ since there's only 1 combo, and it won't have much effect on\nour calculations. Let's reduce the hand range to hands that we're dominating,\nhands that we're flipping with, and hands that crush us:\n\n- 6 combos of hands we crush (TT)\n- 32 combos of hands we're flipping with (AQ, AK)\n- 18 combos of hands that crush us (QQ, KK, AA)\n\n## Pair Combos to Known Equities\n\nWe can simplify by cancelling out hands that we crush, and hands that crush us,\nsince they even out. Let's get rid of TT and AA:\n\n- 32 combos of hands we're flipping with (AQ, AK)\n- 12 combos of hands that crush us (QQ, KK)\n\nFor hands that we're flipping with, we're a 1.2:1 favorite (55%). For hands\nthat crush us, we're a 4:1 dog (20%). In order to make this call profitable,\nour hand equity must be better than our pot equity (2.2:1).\n\n## Combine Analysis\n\nLet's calculate our hand equity. We do this by matching hands that we're\nflipping with, with hands that we crush. If we estimate that our equity when\nwe're flipping is 50%, and our equity when we're crushed is 0%, we can cancel\nthose equities to average out to ~25-30%.\n\n- 12 combos of hands that have ~30% equity.\n- 20 combos of hands that have ~50% equity.\n\nLet's rough up the math. A third of the time, we will win a third of the time.\nTwo-thirds of the time, we will win half the time. So how often do we win\noverall? Let's just average it out:\n\n- (12 * .30) + (20 * .50) / 32\n\nThis yields 42.5% equity, giving us **2.35:1 odds on our money**. Since we're\ngetting 2.2:1 odds on our call, **calling is a profitable play** in terms of\npure chip equity, although we're not too excited by it.\n\n## Other Considerations\n\nAlthough, there is the bubble factor. When we fold, we keep our percentage of\nthe prize pool equity, and when we lose, we lose it all. But considering we\nwere 3-4 spots away from small money, it might not be enough to sway our\ndecision.\n\nThere is also the skill factor. I had a large edge on the player pool, and I\ncould have passed up this spot and look for a better one later. I only had 2.2x\nBB invested, although it was a seventh of my stack.

The Feed transforms the\nFirefoxOS app store to provide an engaging and customized app discovery\nexperience by presenting fresh user-tailored content on every visit.  [The\nconcept was invented by Liu Liu][feed], a Mozilla design intern I briefly hung\nout with last year. Well, it quickly gained traction by getting [featured on\nEngadget][engadget], presented at the Mozilla Summit, and shown off on\nprototypes at Mobile World Congress. With more traction came more pressure to\nship. We built that ship, and it sailed on time.\n\n## Planning Phase\n\nThe whole concept had a large scope so we broke it into four versions. For the\nfirst version, we focused on getting initial content pushing into the Feed. We\nplanned to build a **curation tool** for our editorial team to control the\ncontent of the Feed, with the ability to tailor different content for different\ncountries. Users would then be able to see fresh and new content on the\nhomepage every day, thus increasing engagement.\n\n![Curation Tools](http://imgur.com/LGW9nXn.jpg)\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nThe final product for the Curation Tool, used by the editorial team to feature\ncontent and tailor different content for different countries.\n</span></div>\n\nSome time was spent on the feature requirements and specifications as well as\nthe visual design. We mainly had three engineers: [myself][myself],\n[Chuck][chuck], and [Davor][davor]. It was a slow start. Chuck started early on\nthe technical architecture, building out some APIs and documentation. A few\nmonths later, I started work on the curation tool. My initial work was actually\ndone off-the-grid [in an RV in the middle of\nAlaska](http://imgur.com/LGW9nXn.jpg).\n\nBut then the project to [optimize the app for the $25 FirefoxOS\nsmartphone](/blog/fxos-25-phone/) took over. Once the air cleared, we all\ngathered for a work week hosted at Davor's place in Fort Myers, FL (since I was\nalready in FL for a vacation).\n\n## Building Phase\n\nIn early June, we had a solid start during the work week with each of the three\nof us on working on separate components: Chuck on the backend API, Davor on the\nFeed visuals, me on the curation tools. The face-to-face over remote working\nwas nice. I could ask any question that came to mind about unclear\nrequirements, quickly ask for an API endpoint to be whipped up, or check on how\nthe visuals were looking.\n\nAfter the foundations were in place, I transitioned to working on all parts of\nthe feature from ElasticSearch, the API, the JS powering the curation tools and\nthe Feed, to the CSS for the newer layout of the site. It was a fun grind for a\ncouple of months just writing and refactoring tons of code, getting dirty with\nElasticSearch, optimizing the backend.\n\nThe launch date was set for late August. A couple of weeks out, the feature was\nthere, but there were some bugs to iron out and tons of polish to be done. The\nmost sketchy part was having no design mocks for desktop-sized screens so I had\nto improvise. The last week and a half was a sprint. I split my day up into 6\nhours, a break to play some tournament poker at the poker club, and then 2\nhours at night. Throw in a late Friday, and we made it to the finish line.\n\n## Backend Bits\n\nThe Feed needed to have an early focus on scalability. We should be able to add\nmore and more factors (such as where they're from, what device they're using,\napps they previously installed, content they \"loved\") that tailor the Feed\ntowards each user. ElasticSearch lets us easily dump a bunch of stuff into it,\nand we can do a quick query weighing in all of those factors. We cache the\nresults behind a CDN, throw in couple of layers of client-side caching, and we\ngot a stew going.\n\nFiguring out how to relate data between different indices was a difficult\ndecision. I had [several options in managing relations][esrelation], but chose\nto manually denormalize the data and manage the relations myself. This allowed\nfor flexibility and fine-tuned optimizations without having to wrestle with\nElasticSearch under-the-hood. We had three indices to relate:\n\n- Apps\n- Feed Elements - an individual piece of the Feed such as a featured app or a\ncollection of apps that can contain accompanying descriptions or images.\nMany-to-many relationship with Apps.\n- Feed Items - a wrapper around Feed Elements containing metadata (region,\ncategory, carrier) that helps determine to whom the Feed Element should be\ndisplayed to. Many-to-many relationship with Feed Elements.\n\nThis meant [three ES queries overall][threequery] (and 0 database queries). I\nused the new [ElasticSearch Python DSL][pydsl] to help construct queries. Wrote\na query (weighing all of the factors about a user) to fetch Feed Items, a query\nto fetch all of the Feed Elements to attach to the Feed Items, and a query to\nfetch all of the Apps to attach to the Feed Elements. We throw all of the data\nto our [Django Rest Framework][drf] serializers to deserialize the final\nresponse.\n\nA complication was having to filter out apps, such as when an app is not\npublic, or when an app is banned from the user's region, or when an app is not\nsupported on the user's device. With time constraints, I wrote the filtering\ncode in the view. But after the launch, I was able to consolidate our project's\napp filtering code into single query factory, use that, and tweak our\nserializers to handle filtered apps.\n\n## Frontend Bits\n\nWith the Feed being made of visual blocks and components, [encapsulated\ntemplate macros][macros] kept things clean. These reusable macros could be\nreused by our curation tools to display previews of the Feed on-the-fly for\ncontent curators.  We used Isotope.js to arrange the layout of these visual\nblocks.\n\nOur CSS eventually turned messy, having everything being namespaced by the CSS\nclass *.feed*, and falling under the trap of OOP-style CSS. A good style guide\nto follow in the future is [@fat's CSS style guide for Medium][medium].\n\nAnd since a lot of the code is shared between the frontend of the Firefox\nMarketplace and the curation tools, I'm currently trying to get our reusable\nfrontend assets managed under Bower.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Feed is only going to grow in features. It's a breath of fresh air in\ncomparison to what used to be a never-changing front page on the app store.\nI've seen new apps I've never even knew we had and some are actually fun like\n[Astro Alpaca](https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/astroalpaca).

We mainly had three engineers: [myself][myself],\n[Chuck][chuck], and [Davor][davor]. It was a slow start. Chuck started early on\nthe technical architecture, building out some APIs and documentation. A few\nmonths later, I started work on the curation tool. My initial work was actually\ndone off-the-grid [in an RV in the middle of\nAlaska](http://imgur.com/LGW9nXn.jpg).\n\nBut then the project to [optimize the app for the $25 FirefoxOS\nsmartphone](/blog/fxos-25-phone/) took over. Once the air cleared, we all\ngathered for a work week hosted at Davor's place in Fort Myers, FL (since I was\nalready in FL for a vacation).\n\n## Building Phase\n\nIn early June, we had a solid start during the work week with each of the three\nof us on working on separate components: Chuck on the backend API, Davor on the\nFeed visuals, me on the curation tools. The face-to-face over remote working\nwas nice. I could ask any question that came to mind about unclear\nrequirements, quickly ask for an API endpoint to be whipped up, or check on how\nthe visuals were looking.\n\nAfter the foundations were in place, I transitioned to working on all parts of\nthe feature from ElasticSearch, the API, the JS powering the curation tools and\nthe Feed, to the CSS for the newer layout of the site. It was a fun grind for a\ncouple of months just writing and refactoring tons of code, getting dirty with\nElasticSearch, optimizing the backend.\n\nThe launch date was set for late August. A couple of weeks out, the feature was\nthere, but there were some bugs to iron out and tons of polish to be done. The\nmost sketchy part was having no design mocks for desktop-sized screens so I had\nto improvise. The last week and a half was a sprint. I split my day up into 6\nhours, a break to play some tournament poker at the poker club, and then 2\nhours at night. Throw in a late Friday, and we made it to the finish line.\n\n## Backend Bits\n\nThe Feed needed to have an early focus on scalability. We should be able to add\nmore and more factors (such as where they're from, what device they're using,\napps they previously installed, content they \"loved\") that tailor the Feed\ntowards each user. ElasticSearch lets us easily dump a bunch of stuff into it,\nand we can do a quick query weighing in all of those factors. We cache the\nresults behind a CDN, throw in couple of layers of client-side caching, and we\ngot a stew going.\n\nFiguring out how to relate data between different indices was a difficult\ndecision. I had [several options in managing relations][esrelation], but chose\nto manually denormalize the data and manage the relations myself. This allowed\nfor flexibility and fine-tuned optimizations without having to wrestle with\nElasticSearch under-the-hood. We had three indices to relate:\n\n- Apps\n- Feed Elements - an individual piece of the Feed such as a featured app or a\ncollection of apps that can contain accompanying descriptions or images.\nMany-to-many relationship with Apps.\n- Feed Items - a wrapper around Feed Elements containing metadata (region,\ncategory, carrier) that helps determine to whom the Feed Element should be\ndisplayed to. Many-to-many relationship with Feed Elements.\n\nThis meant [three ES queries overall][threequery] (and 0 database queries). I\nused the new [ElasticSearch Python DSL][pydsl] to help construct queries. Wrote\na query (weighing all of the factors about a user) to fetch Feed Items, a query\nto fetch all of the Feed Elements to attach to the Feed Items, and a query to\nfetch all of the Apps to attach to the Feed Elements. We throw all of the data\nto our [Django Rest Framework][drf] serializers to deserialize the final\nresponse.\n\nA complication was having to filter out apps, such as when an app is not\npublic, or when an app is banned from the user's region, or when an app is not\nsupported on the user's device. With time constraints, I wrote the filtering\ncode in the view. But after the launch, I was able to consolidate our project's\napp filtering code into single query factory, use that, and tweak our\nserializers to handle filtered apps.\n\n## Frontend Bits\n\nWith the Feed being made of visual blocks and components, [encapsulated\ntemplate macros][macros] kept things clean. These reusable macros could be\nreused by our curation tools to display previews of the Feed on-the-fly for\ncontent curators.  We used Isotope.js to arrange the layout of these visual\nblocks.\n\nOur CSS eventually turned messy, having everything being namespaced by the CSS\nclass *.feed*, and falling under the trap of OOP-style CSS. A good style guide\nto follow in the future is [@fat's CSS style guide for Medium][medium].\n\nAnd since a lot of the code is shared between the frontend of the Firefox\nMarketplace and the curation tools, I'm currently trying to get our reusable\nfrontend assets managed under Bower.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Feed is only going to grow in features. It's a breath of fresh air in\ncomparison to what used to be a never-changing front page on the app store.\nI've seen new apps I've never even knew we had and some are actually fun like\n[Astro Alpaca](https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/astroalpaca).

For those months, I was in the top three at my local poker club for\ntournament points. I spent the time after work and tournaments to build out my\npoker app. As a web developer with an iPhone, I wanted to build my app with\nHTML5 but be able to dogfeed it. So I built the app as a hybrid mobile app\nusing [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com). Using this, I then went to\nLondon to facilitate a session on [building hybrid mobile apps at Mozilla\nFestival 2014](/blog/mozfest).

You can *currently* demo it at\n[Shuvit](https://shuvit.ngokevin.com) and [view the\nsource](https://github.com/ngokevin/shuvit) on Github. It's not live on any app\nstores yet, however I'm able to install it as a web app in Safari to my iOS\nhomescreen.  Here's what it currently features:\n\n- Stat tracking\n- Session logging\n- Late tournament push-fold bot\n- Villain journal\n- Dropbox integration\n\nAnd some screen captures:\n\n![villain journal](http://i.imgur.com/JsKod2Al.png)\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\n  Villian journal to keep notes on opponent tendencies.\n</div></span>\n\n![stats page](http://i.imgur.com/XakXr1Hl.png)\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\n  Statistics page to view drilled-down numbers.\n</div></span>\n\n![pushbot](http://i.imgur.com/jTe0tWQl.png)\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\n  Pushbot to calculate push/fold ranges.\n</div></span>\n\n## 11am $1000 Guaranteed - Four Way Chop for $255\n\nI hadn't slept. Running on a non-24-hour sleep cycle, where my sleep schedule\nshifts forward two hours every day, I had just finished working from 8pm to\n9am. I live in sort of an isolated time chamber with no obligations to the\nclock. At home, I don't find much else to do besides work. With my girlfriend\nin another state, I balance free time between photography, poker, and a little\nbit of the piano. Anyways, I was on total auto-pilot, sort of in a carefree\ndaze. But it was enough to take it home. I played patiently at the start,\nand aggressive small-ball towards the end.\n\nThe final four was tougher than usual. One of the players on my right I knew\nwas pretty smart, but he had been giving me a ton of respect the whole game,\nmentioning he doesn't know why he keeps folding to me. Though by now, I think\nagainst him, I seem like a loose caller in all-in situations. The player on\nmy left I was involved in a lot of blind vs. blind situations, we got into\na bit of a verbal metagame.\n\nThe funniest hands were against a guy who's pretty funny and is one of the\nregulars at the club. There was a hand where I raised AKs UTG, with several\ncallers, and he's in the SB. The flop comes wet and low, totally missing me, so\nI check back. Eventually, another guy hits runner-runner flush, and he gets\n*tilted* that I didn't cbet and allowed the flush to get there. He smashed\nthe flop and wanted to check-raise what he thought was going to be an UTG\ncbet. So despite being out of the hand, he steams at me and walks out of the\n\nThough he got me back when I min-raised his BB, and we went to the flop. He\nchecked dark and said *bring me a Jack!*. Well, that threw me off when I Jack\ncame, I didn't cbet my pocket pair and just checked. He bet the turn and I\nfolded. And he showed Q-high.\n\nThere was a hand in the BvB where I limp, to mix it up, from the SB with Q9. He\ncalls. The flop comes Q6x. I bet, he raises, I call. I hit two-pair on the turn\nand we check through.  The river comes another 6, putting a flush on the board.\nI thought a 6 was likely in his range, and I wanted to keep his bluffing range\nin play. So I checked. He became suspicious, \"*I can't believe you didn't bet\nthat...\"*. He checks back and shows trips. I remark, *\"well, I can't believe you\ndidn't bet THAT!\"*. The player to my right tells both of us, *\"I can't\nbelieve neither of you bet!\"*. I saved some chips that hand.\n\nOnce we got to the push/fold stage. We elected to flatten the structure, giving\neveryone $220 even and play winner-take-all for the remaining $90. With\nfour players, it became a silly structure at 220/220/220/310, so we just\nchopped after a few hands.

It binds photos, writing, music, and animation\ntogether into an experential walk down memory lane. I named it\n[Adelheid](http://github.com/ngokevin/adelheid), a long-form version of my\ngirlfriend's name. And it took me about a month of my after-work free time\nwhenever she wasn't around. Adelheid is an amalgamation of my thoughts as it\nmolds my joy of photography, writing, and web development\ninto an elegantly-bound package.\n\n---\n\n![storybook](http://i.imgur.com/dHUr9nR.gif)\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\n  A preview of the personal storybook I put together.\n</span></div>\n\n## Design Process\n\nAs before, I wanted it to a representation of myself: photography, writing, web\ndevelopment. I spent time sketching it out on a notebook and came up with this.\nThe storybook is divided into chapters. Chapters consist of a song, summary\ntext, a key photo, other photos, and moments. Moments are like subchapters;\nthey consist of text and a key photo. Chapters slide left and right like pages\nin a book, photos roll through the bottom like an image reel, moments lie\nbehind the chapters like the back of a notecard, all while music plays in the\nbackground. Then I put in a title page at the beginning that lifts like a stage\ncurtain.\n\nIt took a month of work to bring it to fruition, and it was at last unveiled as\na surprise on a quiet night at Picnic Island Park in Tampa, Florida.\n\n## Technical Bits\n\nWith all of the large image and audio files, it becomes quite a large app. My\nprivate storybook contains about **110MB**, as a single-page app! Well, that's\nquite ludicrous. However, I made it easy for myself and had it intended to only\nbe used as a [packaged app](https://developer.mozilla.org/Marketplace/Options/Packaged_apps).\nThis means I don't have to worry about load times over a web server since all\nassets can be downloaded and installed as a desktop app.\n\nUnfortunately, it currently only works well in Firefox. Chrome was targeted\ninitially but was soon dropped to decrease maintenance time and hit my\ndeadline. There's a lot of fancy animation going on, and it was difficult to\nget it working properly in both browsers. Not only for CSS compatability, but\nit currently only works as a packaged app for Firefox.

Before,\nI had been building a poker app to keep track of my poker winning statistics,\nrecord notes on opponents, and crunch poker math. I used the web as a platform,\nbut having an iPhone, wanted this app to be on iOS. Thus, the solution was\n**hybrid mobile apps**, apps written in HTML5 technologies that are wrapped to\nrun \"natively\" on all platforms (e.g., iOS, Android, FirefoxOS).\n\nI stumbled upon the [Ionic hybrid mobile app\nframework](http://ionicframework.com/). This made app development\nso easy. IT fulfills the promise of the web: write once, run everywhere. In\nbeing with Mozilla for over two years, I've read so little hype for hybrid\nmobile apps. Hybrid mobile apps have potential to convert much more native\ndevelopers over to the web platform, but hybrid mobile apps aren't getting the\nad-time they deserve.\n\n---\n\n## What is a Hybrid Mobile App?\n\nHybrid mobile apps, well explained in\n[this article from\nTelerik](http://blogs.telerik.com/appbuilder/posts/12-06-14/what-is-a-hybrid-mobile-app-),\nare apps written in HTML5 technologies that are enabled to run within a native\ncontainer. They use the device's browser engine to render the app. And then\nweb-to-native polyfill can be injected, prominently\n[Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/), in order to access device APIs.\n\n## The Current Lack of Exposure for Hybrid Mobile Apps\n\nIn all of the [Mozilla\nDeveloper Network](https://developer.mozilla.org) (MDN), there are around three\narticles on hybrid mobile apps, which aren't really fully fleshed and in need\nof technical review. There's been a good amount of work from [James\nLongster](http://jlongster.com) in the form of [Cordova Firefox OS\nsupport](http://http://mozilla-cordova.github.io/). There could be more to be\ndone on the documentation side.\n\nCross-platform capability on mobile should be flaunted more. In MDN's\n[main article on Open Web Apps](https://developer.mozilla.org/Apps/Quickstart/Build/Intro_to_open_web_apps),\nthere's a list of advantages on open web apps. This article is important since\nit is a good entry point to into developing web apps. The advantages listed\nshouldn't really be considered advantages relative to native apps:\n\n- *Local installation and offline storage*: to a developer, these should be\ninherent to an app, not an explicit advantage. Apps are expected to be\ninstallable and have offline storage.\n- *Hardware access*: also should be inherent to an app and not an explicit\nadvantage. Apps are expected to be able to communicate with its device APIs.\n- *Breaking the walled gardens*: there are no \"walls\" being broken if these\nweb apps only run in the browser and FirefoxOS. They should be able to live\ninside the App Store and Play Store to really have any effect.\n- *Open Web App stores*: well, that is prety cool actually. I built a personal\napp that I didn't want to be distributed except with me and antoher. So I\nsimply built a page that had the ability to install the app. However, pure web\napps alone can't be submitted it to App Store or Play Store so that should\nbe addressed first.\n\nWhat's missing here is the biggest advantage of all: **being able to run\ncross-platform** (e.g., iOS, Android, FirefoxOS, Windows). That's the promise\nthe web, and that's what attracts most developers to the web in the first\nplace. Write it once, run anywhere, no need to port between languages or\nframeworks, and still be able to submit to the App Store/Play Store duopoly for\nto gain the most users. For many developers, the web is an appropriate\nplatform, saving time and maintenance.\n\nAdditionally, most developers also prefer the traditional idea of apps, that they are\n[packaged](https://developer.mozilla.org/Marketplace/Options/Packaged_apps) up\nand uploaded to the storefront, rather than self-hosted on a server.  On the\n[Firefox Marketplace](https://marketplace.firefox.com), the majority of apps\nare packaged over hosted (4800 to 4100).\n\nThere's plenty of bark touting the cross-platform capability of the web, but\nthere's little bite on how to actually achieve that on mobile. Hybrid mobile\napps have huge potential to attact more developers to the web platform. But\nwith its lack of exposure, it's wasted potential.\n\nSo what can we do? The presence of hybrid mobile apps on MDN could be buffed.\nI've talked to Chris Mills of the MDN team at Mozfest, and he mentioned it was\na goal for 2015. [FirefoxOS Cordova plugins](http://mozilla-cordova.github.io/)\nmay welcome contributors. And I think the biggest way would be to help **add\nofficial FirefoxOS support to [Ionic](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic)**, a\npopular hybrid mobile app framework which currently has over 11k stars. They've\nmentioned they have FirefoxOS on the roadmap.\n\n## Building with Ionic\n\n[Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) is a hybrid mobile app framework\nIt has a beautifully designed set of native-like icons and CSS components,\npretty UI transitions, web components (through Angular directives for now),\nbuild tools, and an easy-to-use command-line interface.\n\nWith Ionic, I built my poker app I initially mentioned. It installs on my\nphone, and I can use it at the tables:\n\n![Poker app](http://i.imgur.com/IoI7nyol.png)\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\n  Poker app built with Ionic.\n</span></div>\n\nFor the Mozfest session, I generated a sample app with Ionic (that simply just\nmakes use of the camera), and [put it on\nGithub](https://github.com/ngokevin/mozfest2014/tree/master/mozfestApp) with\ninstructions. To get started with a hybrid mobile app:\n\n- ```npm install -g ionic cordova```\n- ```ionic start myApp tabs``` - creates a template app\n- ```cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.camera``` - installs the Cordova\n  camera plugin (there are [many to choose from](http://plugins.cordova.io/))\n- ```ionic platform add <PLATFORM>``` - where <PLATFORM> could be ios, android,\n  or firefoxos. This enables the platforms\n- ```ionic platform build <PLATFORM>``` - builds the project\n\nTo emulate it for iOS or Android:\n\n- ```ionic emulate <PLATFORM>``` - will open the app in XCode for ios or\n  adbtools for android\n\nTo simulate it for FirefoxOS, open the project with WebIDE inside\n```platforms/firefoxos/www```.\n\n## How the Mozfest Session Went\n\nIt was difficult to plan since Mozfest is more of a hands-on unconference,\nwhere everything is meant to be hands-on and accessible. Mozfest wasn't a\ndeeply technical conference so I tried to cater to those who don't have much\ndevelopment experience and to those who don't bring a laptop.\n\nThus I set up three laptops: my Macbook, a Thinkpad, and a Vaio. And had\nthree devices: my iPhone, a Nexus 7, and a FirefoxOS Flame. My Macbook would\nhelp to demonstrate the iOS side. Whereas the other machines had Linux Mint\nwithin a VirtualBox. These VMs had adbtools and Firefox with WebIDE set up.\nAll the mobile devices had the demo apps pre-installed so people could try it\nout.\n\nI was prepared as a boy scout. Well, until my iPhone was pickpocketed in\nLondon, stripping me of the iOS demonstration. Lugging around three laptops\nin my bag that probably amounted to 20 pounds back and forth between the hotel,\nsubway, and venue wasn't fun. I didn't even know what day I was going to\npresent at Mozfest. Then I didn't even use those meticulously prepared laptops\nat the session. Everyone who showed up was pretty knowledgable, had a\nlaptop, and had an internet connection.\n\nThe session went well nonetheless. After a bit of speech about\npushing hybrid mobile apps to the forefront, my Nexus 7 and Flame were passed\naround to demo the sample hybrid mobile app running. It just had a simple\ncamera button. That morning, everyone had received a free Firefox Flame for\nattending Mozfest so it turned more into WebIDE session on how to get an app on\nthe Flame. [My coworker who attended](http://muffinresearch.co.uk/) was\nable to get the accelerometer working with a \"Shake Me / I was shaken.\" app,\nand I was able to get geolocation working with an app that displays longitude\nand latitude coordinates with the GPS.\n\n## What I Thought About Mozfest\n\nThere was a lot of energy in the building. Unfortunately, the energy didn't\nreach me, especially since I was heavily aircraft-latencied. Maybe conferences\naren't my thing. The place was hectic. Hard to find out what was where. I tried\nto go to a session that was labeled as \"The 6th Floor Hub\", which turned out to\nbe a small area of a big open room labelled with a hard-to-spot sign that said\n\"The Hub\". When I got there, there was no session being held despite the\nschedule saying so as the facilitator was MIA.\n\nThe sessions didn't connect with me. Perhaps I wanted something more technical\nand concrete that I could takeaway and use, but most sessions were abstract.\nThere was a big push for Mozilla Webmaker and Appmaker, though those aren't\nsomething I use often. They're great teaching tools, but I usually direct to\nCodecademy for those who want to learn to build stuff.\n\nThere was a lot of what I call \"the web kool-aid\". Don't get me wrong, I love\nthe web, I've drank a lot of the kool-aid, but there was a lot of championing\nof the web in the keynotes. I guess \"agency\" is the new buzzword now. Promoting\nthe web is great, though I've just heard it all before.\n\nHowever, I was glad to add value to those who found it more inspiring and\nmotivating than me. I believe my session went well and attendees took away\nsomething hard and practical. As for me, I was just happy to get back home\nafter a long day of travel and go replace my phone.\n","source":"_posts/076_mozfest.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"Pushing Hybrid Mobile Apps to the Forefront\"\ntype: blog\ncategory: blog\ndate: 2014-11-23\nid: mozfest\ntags: [code, life]\n\nimage:\n    url: http://i.imgur.com/2IGaM6Pl.jpg\n    caption: Mozilla Festival 2014 was held in London in October.\n---\n\nAt [Mozilla Festival 2014](http://2014.mozillafestival.org), I facilitated a\nsession on **Pushing Hybrid Mobile Apps to the Forefront**.

There’s been a good amount of work from <a href=\"http://jlongster.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">James\nLongster</a> in the form of <a href=\"http://http://mozilla-cordova.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Cordova Firefox OS\nsupport</a>. There could be more to be\ndone on the documentation side.</p>\n<p>Cross-platform capability on mobile should be flaunted more. In MDN’s\n<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/Apps/Quickstart/Build/Intro_to_open_web_apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">main article on Open Web Apps</a>,\nthere’s a list of advantages on open web apps. This article is important since\nit is a good entry point to into developing web apps. The advantages listed\nshouldn’t really be considered advantages relative to native apps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Local installation and offline storage</em>: to a developer, these should be\ninherent to an app, not an explicit advantage. Apps are expected to be\ninstallable and have offline storage.</li>\n<li><em>Hardware access</em>: also should be inherent to an app and not an explicit\nadvantage. Apps are expected to be able to communicate with its device APIs.</li>\n<li><em>Breaking the walled gardens</em>: there are no “walls” being broken if these\nweb apps only run in the browser and FirefoxOS. They should be able to live\ninside the App Store and Play Store to really have any effect.</li>\n<li><em>Open Web App stores</em>: well, that is prety cool actually. I built a personal\napp that I didn’t want to be distributed except with me and antoher. So I\nsimply built a page that had the ability to install the app. However, pure web\napps alone can’t be submitted it to App Store or Play Store so that should\nbe addressed first.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What’s missing here is the biggest advantage of all: <strong>being able to run\ncross-platform</strong> (e.g., iOS, Android, FirefoxOS, Windows). That’s the promise\nthe web, and that’s what attracts most developers to the web in the first\nplace. Write it once, run anywhere, no need to port between languages or\nframeworks, and still be able to submit to the App Store/Play Store duopoly for\nto gain the most users. For many developers, the web is an appropriate\nplatform, saving time and maintenance.</p>\n<p>Additionally, most developers also prefer the traditional idea of apps, that they are\n<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/Marketplace/Options/Packaged_apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">packaged</a> up\nand uploaded to the storefront, rather than self-hosted on a server.  On the\n<a href=\"https://marketplace.firefox.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Firefox Marketplace</a>, the majority of apps\nare packaged over hosted (4800 to 4100).</p>\n<p>There’s plenty of bark touting the cross-platform capability of the web, but\nthere’s little bite on how to actually achieve that on mobile. Hybrid mobile\napps have huge potential to attact more developers to the web platform. But\nwith its lack of exposure, it’s wasted potential.</p>\n<p>So what can we do? The presence of hybrid mobile apps on MDN could be buffed.\nI’ve talked to Chris Mills of the MDN team at Mozfest, and he mentioned it was\na goal for 2015. <a href=\"http://mozilla-cordova.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">FirefoxOS Cordova plugins</a>\nmay welcome contributors. And I think the biggest way would be to help <strong>add\nofficial FirefoxOS support to <a href=\"https://github.com/driftyco/ionic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Ionic</a></strong>, a\npopular hybrid mobile app framework which currently has over 11k stars.

I was\nprepared to pop bottles and sign contracts. It had been a battlefield, the war\nfor living space against the antagonist anonymous Padmappers. We surged upon\nopen listings on the day they appeared yet we were always outflanked by a\nfaster hunter who snatched them up within hours. But alas the end was in sight.\nfor we believed we had finally found home in a hopeless place.\n\n---\n\nThe humble place was an oasis on the warfront.  A small studio nestled within a\nquiet community. Walking in, I overheard a small kid asking his mom whether or\nnot that stranger loading up that pickup truck was his father. And then asking\nwhat his father looked like despite having just seen him that morning. The Yelp\nreviews mentioned new management had turned the place around recently for the\nbetter. And it was a fair bargain considering the market in San Rafael of Marin\nCounty. It was a few seconds before I concluded the place was close to perfect.\nEverything checked out and I was en route to the world record for fastest\napartment signing. Until I received a hyperbolically-fateful text.\n\nNever had I been so sure of something before having my mind completely flipped.\nIt was from my fiancee, my comrade in the trenches. Yesterday, she had sent an\nemail to what made the place I was about to sign with look like a safety\ncollege, the Lofts. I had thought the email was more futile than a\nthree-hundred and sixty degree scopeless bullet. The Lofts had not listed any\navailable studios on their website, which was supposedly a source of truth. But\nlike Criss Angel, she had seemed to produced a miracle without any camera\ntricks.\n\n*\"The Lofts just emailed me back, they have a studio open.\"*.\n\nIf I were to dramatize it in my mind, it would be akin to the ink of a pen\nmillimeters from the contract before I suddenly stood up, ripped it in half,\nand skateboarded away. Except, I did skateboard away, pushing and sprinting to\nthe Lofts which was no less than three blocks from the property I was courting.\nI reached the leasing office, taking a second to reset so I hadn't looked like\nI just ran a three-legged marathon. The leasing agent welcomed me in.\n\n*\"So I heard you have a studio open\"*\n\nThe leasing agent looked over to the other guy in the room, an older\nsoftly-spoken man on his first day of the job.\n\n*\"I told you they go quick!\"*, the charismatic leasing agent remarked in\namusement.\n\nBefore they had even publically listed the studio that day, I rolled in on my\nwooden steed inquiring about it less than five minutes since they had responded\nto my fiancee's email. A larger space, at a lower price, in a nicer location\nright off downtown, with even more friendly management. They didn't even need\nto tell me about the in-unit washer and dryer. Air support had arrived and we\nwere sold.\n\n### Less Dramatic Tidbits\n\n- We came from Portland, OR. Fiancee took a job in Novato, and I was flexible\nenough to relocate, also gaining the benefit to commute (via ferry!) to the\noffice on the San Francisco Embarcadero waterfront.\n- We had been scouting Richmond, CA as a potential dropzone for weeks. After\nan espionage mission, I promptly nope'd my way out of there. Place was straight\nout of the Wire.\n- Fiancee now working at [Zenni Optical](https://zennioptical.com), who\ngraciously set us up with a week of great housing to get us settled. They sell\n$6.95 glasses including prescription!\n- The North Bay, maybe the closest thing resembling Oregon in California, but\nwith its own flair. Rolling yellow hills bushed in little, happy trees. Birds\nchirping, and Redwoods all around.

There was an old Asian gambler at the table\nthat I keyed into all night, I had value bet my hands mercilessly. I have never\nseen so much action at a table.\n\nThe second night, I went up +$366. The action was still alive. Aggression was\nrampant. I got into a 5-bet pot with A8s to hit a full house. Later, I lost\na large hand where I squeezed an UTG raiser with AKo, only to check-call and\ncheck-fold a missed flop.\n\nThe third night, after Mozilla decided to surprise the crew with a surprise\nMacklemore & Ryan Lewis at a venue I used to live across the street from, I\nwent up +$149. I saw the old Asian guy again! I rushed to the table to try to\nget a seat directly on his left. Although later, I was down over two buy-ins\nafter making a loose call with a flush draw and two overcards on the turn, but\nI tripled up with JJ all-in preflop against AK and AJ to hit a full house on\nthe flop.\n\n## Final Table Sessions\n\nAfter all the action at the Encore, I took it home to the Final Table Poker\nClub. Cash games didn't fare well there. My first session there, I went down\n-$280, where I felt myself becoming tilted and too aggressive. I became too\nused to the action at the Encore and didn't adjust well enough for the\nloose-passives.\n\n## Session 5\n\nMy second session at the Final Table, I went down -$95. I lost an all-in\npreflop with AQo against AJo and A9o where I limp-backraised. A 9 hit on the\nriver and I took a small sidepot for a net loss. There was a lady who I know\ncould read me for a TAG and was floating my cbets, I should be able to adjust\nto those who are playing back.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith the switch to cash games, I'm trying to adjust to playing less urgently\nlike I would in tournaments.

I deliberated whether or not to value-bet, and I ended up betting\na small amount. If he had an Ace, he would probably be scared of a flush or\nlarger Ace. A Jack probably would fold. A flush would raise.

I wanted it to behave\nexactly like a ```<select>``` element, complete with its interface, but with\nthe full license to style it however I needed.\n\nIn this post, I'll go over Custom Elements, introduce an interesting \"proxy\"\npattern to extend native elements, and then compare Custom Elements with the\ncurrently reigning Component king, [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).\n\n---\n\n[Custom Select source code](https://github.com/mozilla/fireplace/blob/36ed622f6944a375d5d34e836025895fd149e91d/src/media/js/elements/select.js).\n\n## Building a Custom Element\n\n[Custom\nElements](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/customelements/)\nare still in working draft, but there is a nice [document.registerElement\npolyfill](https://github.com/WebReflection/document-register-element). Here\nis an extremely simple Custom Element that simple wraps a ```div``` and\ndefines some interface on the element's prototype.\n\n    ::js\n    document.registerElement('input-wrapper', {\n        prototype: Object.create(HTMLElement.prototype, {\n            createdCallback: {\n                value: function () {\n                    // Called after the component is \"mounted\" onto the DOM.\n                    this.appendChild(document.createElement('input'));\n                }\n            },\n            input: {\n                get: function() {\n                    return this.querySelector('input');\n                }\n            },\n            value: {\n                get: function() {\n                    return this.input.value;\n                },\n                set: function(val) {\n                    this.input.value = val;\n                }\n            }\n        })\n    });\n\n    var inputWrapper = document.createElement('input-wrapper');\n    document.body.appendChild(inputWrapper);\n\nWe define the interface using Javascript's ```Object.create```, extending the\nbasic ```HTMLElement```. The element simply wraps an input, and provides a\ngetter and setter on the input's value. We drop it into the DOM, and it will\nnatively have whatever interface we defined for it. So we could do something\nlike ```inputWrapper.value = 5``` to directly set the inner ```input```'s\nvalue. Basic example, but being able to create these native Custom Elements can\ngo far in modular development.\n\n## Proxy Pattern: Extending the Select Element by Rerouting Interface\n\nNow we got a gist of what a Custom Element is, let's see how we can use it to\ncreate a custom dropdown by extending the native ```<select>``` element.\n\nHere's an example of how our element will be used in the HTML:\n\n    ::html\n    <custom-select name=\"my-select\">\n      <custom-selected>\n        The current selected option is <custom-selected-text></custom-selected-text>\n      </custom-selected>\n      <optgroup>\n        <option value=\"1\">First value</option>\n        <option value=\"2\">Second value</option>\n        <option value=\"3\">Third value</option>\n        <option value=\"4\">Fourth value</option>\n      </optgroup>\n    </mkt-select>\n\nWhat we'll do in the ```createdCallback``` is, if you check the source code,\ncreate an actual internal hidden select element, copying the attributes\ndefined on ```<custom-select>```. Then we'll create ```<custom-options>```,\ncopying the original options into the hidden select. We extend the custom\nselect's interface to have an attribute pointing to the hidden select like so:\n\n    ::js\n    select: {\n        // Actual <select> element to proxy to, steal its interface.\n        // Value set in the createdCallback.\n        get: function() {\n            return this._select;\n        },\n        set: function(select) {\n            copyAttrs(select, this);\n            this._select = select;\n        }\n    },\n\nThis will allow our custom element to *absorb* the functionality of the\nnative select element. All we have to do is implement the entire interface of\nthe select element by routing to the internal select element.\n\n    ::js\n    function proxyInterface(destObj, properties, methods, key) {\n        // Proxies destObj.<properties> and destObj.<methods>() to\n        // destObj.<key>.\n        properties.forEach(function(prop) {\n            if (Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(destObj, prop)) {\n                // Already defined.\n                return;\n            }\n            // Set a property.\n            Object.defineProperty(destObj, prop, {\n                get: function() {\n                    return this[key][prop];\n                }\n            });\n        });\n\n        methods.forEach(function(method) {\n            // Set a method.\n            Object.defineProperty(destObj, method, {\n                value: function() {\n                    return this[key][method].call(arguments);\n                }\n            });\n        });\n    }\n\n    proxyInterface(CustomSelectElement.prototype,\n        ['autofocus', 'disabled', 'form', 'labels', 'length', 'multiple',\n         'name', 'onchange', 'options', 'required', 'selectedIndex', 'size',\n         'type', 'validationMessage', 'validity', 'willValidate'],\n\n        ['add', 'blur', 'checkValidity', 'focus', 'item', 'namedItem',\n         'remove', 'setCustomValidity'],\n\n        'select');\n\n```proxyInterface``` will \"route\" the property lookups (the first array), and\nmethod calls (the second array) from the custom select element to the internal\nselect element. Then all we need to do is make sure our select element's value\nis up-to-date while we interact with our custom select element, then we can do\nthings like ```customSelectElement.selectedIndex``` or\n```customSelectElement.checkValidity()``` without manually implementing the\ninterface.\n\nNote we could have simply looped over ```HTMLSelectElement.prototype``` rather\nthan manually entering in each property and method name, but unfortunately that\ndoesn't play well with some older browsers.\n\nWith all of this, we have a custom select element that is fully stylizable\nwhile having all the functionality of a native select element (because it\nextends it!).\n\n## Comparing Custom Elements to React\n\nI love React and am using it for a couple of projects. How does Custom Elements\ncompare to it?\n\n1. Custom Elements has no answer to React's JSX template/syntax. In most of\nour Custom Elements, we have to manually shuffle things around using the native\nDOM API. JSX is much, much easier.\n\n2. Custom Elements has no data-binding or automatic DOM updates whenever data\nupdates. It's all imperative with Custom Elements, you have to listen for changes\nand manually update the DOM. React is, well, reactive. Whenever a component's\nstate, so does its representation in the DOM.\n\n3. Custom Elements is a bit harder to nest components than React. In React,\nit's natural for a component to render a component that renders a component\nthat renders other components. With Custom Elements, it's a bit difficult to\nconnect components together in a nice heirarchy, and the only communication\nyou get is through Events.\n\n4. Custom Elements, however, is smaller in KB. React is about 26KB after\nmin+gzip whereas a Custom Elements polyfill is maybe a few KB. Though the 26KB\nmight be worth it since you'll end up writing less code, and you get the\nperformance of virtual DOM diffing.\n\n5. Custom Elements has no answer to React Native.\n\nThey're both just as portable, they both can be dropped into any framework.\nThey both have similar interfaces as well in creating components. Although,\nReact is more powerful. In React, I really enjoy keeping data compartmentalized\nin states and passing down data as props. Loose comparison, but it's like\ncombining the data-binding and template power of Angular with the ideas of\nCustom Elements.\n\nHowever, it doesn't have to be one or the other either. Why not both? React can\nwrap Custom Elements if you want it to. As always, choose the best tools for\nthe job.\n","source":"_posts/083_custom_elements_react.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"Dropdown Component Using Custom Elements (vs. React)\"\ntype: blog\ncategory: blog\ndate: 2015-05-14\nid: custom-elements-react\ntags: [code]\n\nimage:\n    url: http://i.imgur.com/zPR4gcE.png\n    caption: Dropdowns have never been easier and native.\n---\n\nWe have been building an increasing amount of [Custom\nElements](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Web_Components/Custom_Elements),\nor Web Components, over at the [Firefox\nMarketplace](https://marketplace.firefox.com) (using a\n[polyfill](https://github.com/WebReflection/document-register-element)).

And if you're\ngoing to have fun with something, have an activity to relax with, study\nsomething you love, why not bring home some cash while you're at it?\n\n## Cash Games vs. Tournaments\n\nI am seriously running under EV after busting *deep* in a $50K tournament\ngetting sucked out on with Aces, I took the hit and kept on trucking through a\nlong break-even period.\n\nCash games have been much kinder on my soul. I don't have to go through with\nplaying perfect for hours at a time to have it all go to waste on 50/50 race.\nGood decisions pay off immediately in cash games.\n\nAlthough, I think my tournament game is better than my cash game, not having\nall that variance is a load off. I'm confident in my preflop game, honing\nthat through tournaments, and my postflop game is getting better as I make\nstrides on hand-reading and putting people on ranges.\n\n## +$130 Session - Four-Handed\n\nThis was what I thought would be a big night. It was Game 1 of the NBA Western\nConference Finals, Warriors vs. Rockets. Everyone would be at the club\nwatching, drinking, playing. The game would be soft like a drink, and I'm\ndrinking Pepsi. When I arrived, there were already four people waiting so I had\nto wait about an hour for a seat.\n\nA table started up with about 5-6 players, eventually dwindling to 4. I chose\nmy seat, wanting position on whom I thought would be the tougher opponent. I went\noff of looks, but ultimately choosing an unideal seat. I ended up having position\non someone I really didn't need it on, and was out-of-position against two\nvillains I would be faring off with all session. A couple of old dudes, one in\na cowboy hat.\n\n## Defending Against a Donk-Bettor\n\nWe played four-handed for about an hour. I went down -$110. I was playing\naggressively seeing how everyone was passive. I raised A7s on the button,\ncowboy villain calls. He had the propensity to donk bet almost every pot, so I\nwas trying to figure how to defend against it. He donk bet a flop where I had\na backdoor flush, an over, and position, so I called. Turn came an Ace. He\nled out, and I raised wanting to get value from the possible straight draw. He\ncalled. Then he donk-led out big on the river. I didn't have enough\ninformation, he could have easily had two-pair, a bigger Ace, or he could have\nbeen bluffing a busted straight. So I folded.\n\nThough I got involved with him in a later hand, but this time I was better\narmed with information. I raised on the button with 76o, he called. I hit\ntop pair on the flop, and he donk-bet. I planned to check-call three streets.\nSo I called the flop, and his subsequent turn bet. River gave me two-pair, but\nput our a 4-card straight. He made a large river bet. I though for a while,\nand deduced that it was improbable he could have made a straight given the\naction, and possibly he was value-betting an overpair or like A7. So I nutted\nup and made the call. He wasn't going to get me twice. He showed the bluff, and\nI took down the pot.\n\n## Pot Control Line with TPTK\n\nWeak-tight player on my right limps. I raise with AQo. He calls. Flop comes\nQxx, two-tone. I cbet, he calls. Turn completes the flush. So here I had the\ndecision whether to barrel. This is where I take a strong pot control line.\nIf I barrel, I often fold out weaker hands especially with the flush out there,\nand mostly flushes call. So I check back with the intent to call a river bet or\nmake a river bet. Villain leads out seeing I showed apparent weakness on the\nturn, and I call. Villain shows KQ, I take the pot.\n\n## Trust the Beluga Theorem\n\nThere's a theorem in poker called the Beluga Theorem which started in the\nforums. When faced with a raise on the turn, strongly re-consider one-pair\nhands. Well, I should have listened. I checked the BB with 92, making top-pair.\nI bet out the flop and turn, getting raised on the turn. There was a possible\nstraight draw out there (789) he held a Ten and was semi-bluffing. But he\nwas a passive calling station type. I incorrectly called with a one-pair hand.\nThe river put out the straight, which saved me from calling another river bet\nas he showed town 97 for the two-pair.\n","source":"_posts/085_poker25.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"Poker Sess.25 - $5K Dance\"\ntype: blog\ncategory: blog\ndate: 2015-05-19\nid: poker25\ntags: [poker]\n\nimage:\n    url: http://i.imgur.com/135RG5M.jpg\n    caption: Reflecting upon the Dark Side of poker.\n---\n\nAchievement unlocked! $5000 profit logged since playing live poker.

Unfortunately, my\nplay degraded as I didn't adjust from 6-handed to full-ring poker.\n\n## Bad Call with Overpair\n\nI have **TT** on the button. First player raises, two callers. I just call with\nTT since I want to be cautious with an UTG raiser. Blinds call along. Flop\ncomes **256 with a flush draw**. Initial raiser bets, a caller, and I 3bet. The\n**SB then check-raises all-in for $190**. It folds to me. Kid starts playing\nwith his phone while I contemplate. I thought of his possible holdings (flush\ndraw, set, open-ender, sixes over fives) against my overpair. Though I\n*mistakenly* called. Against that range, my hand was mostly likely behind.

Three callers. Flop comes **QQ3**. I cbet as it'd be hard for anything\nbut a Queen to call. One caller so I shut down. Though I make a backdoor flush\non a QQ33x board. He bets out small $50 about third-pot, and I made a bad call\nwith the flush. The call on the flop is almost always a Queen (or at least a\n3). I'm never ahead here.\n\nI start getting aggressive. Maybe it's tilt, but it seems when I play in this\nmode, I take down a lot of pots. I had several hands of raises and cbetting\ninto players.\n\n## Flopping Quads\n\nWell, sometimes the gods bail you out of a session. I get **KK** for the third\ntime in the session, and I 3-bet squeeze a straddled pot. 3 callers! The pot is\nabout $170 to the flop.\n\nThe window shows a K. Sweet.\n\nAnd then another K. Like a dumbass, I lean out of my chair to see if this was\nactually happening. The odds of flopping quads are 407-to-1. So it checks\naround to me, the aggressor.

Obviously, if he was bluffing, he would know i have something at this\npoint. Everyone else folds.\n\nOpponent checks the river. It's hard for him to have anything besides a rag\npair.

Money that could instead be be put to long-term investment to grow.\nAt the beginning of the year, I was merely maxing my traditional 401K.  That\nwas easy since I simply had to plug in a percentage of my income through\n[Fidelity](http://401k.fidelity.com). Though I could have stood to diversify\nand put in more. With [/r/personalfinance](http://reddit.com/r/personalfinance)\nas a jumping off point, my finances and portfolio have come a long way. Here's\nhow.\n\n---\n\nLet's start off with finances.\n\n## Banking\n\nFor my checking account, I just use [Chase](http://chase.com). Simply some\nmoney for expenses and some emergency funds. Although it is generally\nrecommended to have three to six months of emergency funds, I am a bit more\nliberal since I'm well set up against emergencies.\n\nThe juicy part is for the savings account. I started using\n[Ally](http://ally.com) because they offer a whopping **0.99%** annual\npercentage yield (APY) on their savings accounts. For comparison, Chase gives a\nmere *0.05%* APY on theirs. If you have $10K in your savings, that's a $100\nannual yield versus a $5 annual yield. It gets even stronger with compounding.\n\n[Discover](https://discover.com) is a great option as well. They offer\n**0.95%** APY. My SO has a Discover savings account, then we can can take\nadvantage of each of the banks' unique revolving credit card rewards. Onto\ncredit.\n\n## Credit Cards\n\nI recently signed up for the [Citi Double\nCash](http://www.citicards.com/DoubleCash), which has become my general purpose\ncredit card. It offers **2%** cashback on *all* purchases. Amazing, though\nyou'll want a couple of other credit cards to back it up.\n\nThe [Chase Freedom card](http://creditcards.chase.com/Freedom) is decent with\nits **1%** cashback on all purchases. You may be wondering why I'd need this\nsince 1 is less than 2. Every quarter, the Chase Freedom presents **5% cashback\nselect categories** (e.g., gas stations, restaurants, theme parks). So I can\ntake advantage of purchases that fall into those revolving categories, and fall\nback to the Citi Double Cash for every other purchase.\n\nThe [Discover card](http://discovercard.com) is the same as the Chase Freedom,\nalthough it also offers 5% cashback on quarterly select categories. So I can\nuse this card if a purchases is within the category, else use the Chase Freedom\nif a purchases is within its categories, else use the Citi Double Cash. It also\nhas some permanent 5% cashback categories such as Century Cinema theaters and\nSix Flags, which is nice.\n\n## Investment Portfolio\n\nAnd onto investment. You'll want to do this when you have enough money for\nexpenses and an emergency fund. Note that even if you have student loans,\nyou should think about investing since long-term gains from investment outpace\nstudent loan interests.\n\nThere are two good online options for managing investments,\n[Vanguard](http://vanguard.com) and [Fidelity](http://401.fidelity.com). I like\nVanguard because their fund management fees are substantially cheaper. Though\nI use Fidelity to manage my 401K since it's attached to my employer.\n\n### Traditional 401K\n\nA traditional 401K is a retirement account where contributions grow tax-free,\nand tax is applied upon withdrawals. The annual contribution limit is around\n$17,500.\n\nFirst things first, if your employer does any sort of contribution\nmatching on 401K, contribute up to the match. It's free money. Mine does, so I\ncontribute up to the match.\n\n### Roth IRA\n\nA Roth IRA is like the opposite of a 401K, contributions are taxed, but\nwithdrawals are tax-free. This is good if you expect your future tax bracket to\nbe higher than your current one. For most people, the annual contribution limit\nis $5,500. Vanguard is a good place to set up a Roth IRA.\n\nOnce you put enough into your 401K get any contribution matching, you'll\n*really* want to put as much as you can into your Roth IRA. Everyone should\nwish they started theirs as early as possible. Unlike a 401K, you can withdraw\nyour contributions at any time, even before you retire! However, the earnings\nmust stay until retirement. They also offer some breaks on withdrawals for\nhouse down payments and such.\n\nIf you have maxed out your Roth IRA, then you can go ahead and dump some more\ninto the traditional 401K.\n\n### Index Funds\n\nIf you still got some liquidity lying around, you can think about investing\nin index funds. Index funds are managed by investors that put your money to\nan extremely diversified set of stocks and bonds such that the fund will\ngenerally fall and grow with the entire market. One stock crashing will have\nvirtually no effect on the entire fund.\n\nWith the money remaining in my bank, I found a good basic portfolio consisting\nof three funds from the [/r/personalfinance\nWiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/investing#wiki_can_you_just_recommend_something_extremely_specific_to_get_me_started.3F). The most common recommendation is:\n\n- [Total US Stock Market Index Fund](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0085&FundIntExt=INT)\n- [Total International Stock Market Index Fund](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0113&FundIntExt=INT)\n- [Total Bond Market Index Fund](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0084&FundIntExt=INT)\n\nFirst, you want to figure how much to allocate to stocks and how much to bonds.\nThe recommendation was to subtract your age from 100, and that's the percentage\nto put into stocks, and the rest into bonds. For instance, my age is 24, so\nI'd put about 75% into stocks and 25% into bonds. Stocks are more risky, but\nthe lower the age, the more time in market for long-term growth. Bonds are more\nstable, but don't offer as much upside, so you want to rebalance to bonds as\nyou grow older.\n\nSecond, out of the allocated stock market percentage, put 80% into the US\nmarket, and the rest into the international market. For my age, I get a total\nallocation of:\n\n- 64%: Total US Stock Market Index Fund\n- 20%: Total Bond Market Index Fund\n- 16%: Total International Market Index Fund\n\nOn Vanguard, if you contribute up to a certain minimum, you can qualify for the\nAdmiral version of the shares, which has a much lower management cost to you.\n\n## Recap\n\nLuckily, I ordered my shares recently while the international market shares are\nlow, and after the whole NASDAQ outage. Can't wait to have my money working for\nme. In conclusion:\n\n1. Have an emergency fund to last at least three to six months.\n2. Use Ally for savings accounts.\n3. Use Citi Double Cash as a main credit card, with Chase Freedom and Discover\nas backups for rewards.\n4. Contribute to traditional 401K up to the employer match, if any.\n5. Contribute to a Roth IRA as much as possible up to the max.\n6. Contribute a bit more to a traditional 401K if money remaining.\n7. Invest in index funds on Vanguard with a stronger focus on stocks the\nyounger you are, weighted towards the total US stock market.\n8. Any remaining money? Play poker, like me!\n\nBecause unused money in the bank rots away at 3% inflation, when they could be\ngrowing and compounding by 10% in a portfolio.\n","source":"_posts/087_investment.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"Taking Control of Personal Finances and Investment Portfolio\"\ntype: blog\ncategory: blog\ndate: 2015-07-10\nid: investing\ntags: [life]\n\nimage:\n    url: http://i.imgur.com/YOLNpsx.jpg\n    caption: Monopoly card game, buying up Boardwalk.\n---\n\nTwo years out of university, and my money is rotting in the bank through\ninflation.

Here's\nhow.\n\n---\n\nLet's start off with finances.\n\n## Banking\n\nFor my checking account, I just use [Chase](http://chase.com). Simply some\nmoney for expenses and some emergency funds. Although it is generally\nrecommended to have three to six months of emergency funds, I am a bit more\nliberal since I'm well set up against emergencies.\n\nThe juicy part is for the savings account. I started using\n[Ally](http://ally.com) because they offer a whopping **0.99%** annual\npercentage yield (APY) on their savings accounts. For comparison, Chase gives a\nmere *0.05%* APY on theirs. If you have $10K in your savings, that's a $100\nannual yield versus a $5 annual yield. It gets even stronger with compounding.\n\n[Discover](https://discover.com) is a great option as well. They offer\n**0.95%** APY. My SO has a Discover savings account, then we can can take\nadvantage of each of the banks' unique revolving credit card rewards. Onto\ncredit.\n\n## Credit Cards\n\nI recently signed up for the [Citi Double\nCash](http://www.citicards.com/DoubleCash), which has become my general purpose\ncredit card. It offers **2%** cashback on *all* purchases. Amazing, though\nyou'll want a couple of other credit cards to back it up.\n\nThe [Chase Freedom card](http://creditcards.chase.com/Freedom) is decent with\nits **1%** cashback on all purchases. You may be wondering why I'd need this\nsince 1 is less than 2. Every quarter, the Chase Freedom presents **5% cashback\nselect categories** (e.g., gas stations, restaurants, theme parks). So I can\ntake advantage of purchases that fall into those revolving categories, and fall\nback to the Citi Double Cash for every other purchase.\n\nThe [Discover card](http://discovercard.com) is the same as the Chase Freedom,\nalthough it also offers 5% cashback on quarterly select categories. So I can\nuse this card if a purchases is within the category, else use the Chase Freedom\nif a purchases is within its categories, else use the Citi Double Cash. It also\nhas some permanent 5% cashback categories such as Century Cinema theaters and\nSix Flags, which is nice.\n\n## Investment Portfolio\n\nAnd onto investment. You'll want to do this when you have enough money for\nexpenses and an emergency fund. Note that even if you have student loans,\nyou should think about investing since long-term gains from investment outpace\nstudent loan interests.\n\nThere are two good online options for managing investments,\n[Vanguard](http://vanguard.com) and [Fidelity](http://401.fidelity.com). I like\nVanguard because their fund management fees are substantially cheaper. Though\nI use Fidelity to manage my 401K since it's attached to my employer.\n\n### Traditional 401K\n\nA traditional 401K is a retirement account where contributions grow tax-free,\nand tax is applied upon withdrawals. The annual contribution limit is around\n$17,500.\n\nFirst things first, if your employer does any sort of contribution\nmatching on 401K, contribute up to the match. It's free money. Mine does, so I\ncontribute up to the match.\n\n### Roth IRA\n\nA Roth IRA is like the opposite of a 401K, contributions are taxed, but\nwithdrawals are tax-free. This is good if you expect your future tax bracket to\nbe higher than your current one. For most people, the annual contribution limit\nis $5,500. Vanguard is a good place to set up a Roth IRA.\n\nOnce you put enough into your 401K get any contribution matching, you'll\n*really* want to put as much as you can into your Roth IRA. Everyone should\nwish they started theirs as early as possible. Unlike a 401K, you can withdraw\nyour contributions at any time, even before you retire! However, the earnings\nmust stay until retirement. They also offer some breaks on withdrawals for\nhouse down payments and such.\n\nIf you have maxed out your Roth IRA, then you can go ahead and dump some more\ninto the traditional 401K.\n\n### Index Funds\n\nIf you still got some liquidity lying around, you can think about investing\nin index funds. Index funds are managed by investors that put your money to\nan extremely diversified set of stocks and bonds such that the fund will\ngenerally fall and grow with the entire market. One stock crashing will have\nvirtually no effect on the entire fund.\n\nWith the money remaining in my bank, I found a good basic portfolio consisting\nof three funds from the [/r/personalfinance\nWiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/investing#wiki_can_you_just_recommend_something_extremely_specific_to_get_me_started.3F). The most common recommendation is:\n\n- [Total US Stock Market Index Fund](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0085&FundIntExt=INT)\n- [Total International Stock Market Index Fund](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0113&FundIntExt=INT)\n- [Total Bond Market Index Fund](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0084&FundIntExt=INT)\n\nFirst, you want to figure how much to allocate to stocks and how much to bonds.\nThe recommendation was to subtract your age from 100, and that's the percentage\nto put into stocks, and the rest into bonds. For instance, my age is 24, so\nI'd put about 75% into stocks and 25% into bonds. Stocks are more risky, but\nthe lower the age, the more time in market for long-term growth. Bonds are more\nstable, but don't offer as much upside, so you want to rebalance to bonds as\nyou grow older.\n\nSecond, out of the allocated stock market percentage, put 80% into the US\nmarket, and the rest into the international market. For my age, I get a total\nallocation of:\n\n- 64%: Total US Stock Market Index Fund\n- 20%: Total Bond Market Index Fund\n- 16%: Total International Market Index Fund\n\nOn Vanguard, if you contribute up to a certain minimum, you can qualify for the\nAdmiral version of the shares, which has a much lower management cost to you.\n\n## Recap\n\nLuckily, I ordered my shares recently while the international market shares are\nlow, and after the whole NASDAQ outage. Can't wait to have my money working for\nme. In conclusion:\n\n1. Have an emergency fund to last at least three to six months.\n2. Use Ally for savings accounts.\n3. Use Citi Double Cash as a main credit card, with Chase Freedom and Discover\nas backups for rewards.\n4. Contribute to traditional 401K up to the employer match, if any.\n5. Contribute to a Roth IRA as much as possible up to the max.\n6. Contribute a bit more to a traditional 401K if money remaining.\n7. Invest in index funds on Vanguard with a stronger focus on stocks the\nyounger you are, weighted towards the total US stock market.\n8. Any remaining money? Play poker, like me!\n\nBecause unused money in the bank rots away at 3% inflation, when they could be\ngrowing and compounding by 10% in a portfolio.\n","slug":"087_investment","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-24T10:25:46.000Z","_id":"cj4b2m16m0078gyi7b4d51oz8","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","content":"<p>Two years out of university, and my money is rotting in the bank through\ninflation.

Atop Whistler Mountain near Vancouver, BC."},"_content":"\nI'm working on submission and reviewer tools for FirefoxOS add-ons, which I'd\nlike to shout out is the most exciting thing to hit FirefoxOS yet. It'll enable\na customization community as powerful as CyanogenMod yet be much more\naccessible.\n\nFor this project, I wanted to port our Flux framework from\n[Flummox](http://acdlite.github.io/flummox) to\n[Redux](http://rackt.github.io/redux/docs/introduction/index.html) while using\n[react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/). I always struggle with\ngetting react-router to pass Redux-related context to the handler components.\nHaving done this twice and running into many pitfalls, I am sharing my\nexperiences to prospective struggle-bus riders.\n\n---\n\nNote this guide will feature:\n\n- ES6 code\n- react@0.13\n- react-redux@0.9.0\n- react-router@1.0.0-beta1\n- redux@1.0.0\n\nIf you are behind on these versions, I recommend upgrading. The Flux community\nis moving very rapidly, so keep up.\n\n### app.js\n\nHave your Redux store created. This is explained in the Redux documentation so\nI won't go into detail here. But I will note that we are using\n[acdlite's](https://github.com/acdlite) ```redux-react-router``` library which\nconveniently makes availalbe react-router state inside of our Redux store, and\nfeatures action creators for react-router.\n\n    ::javascript\n    import React from 'react';\n    import {Provider} from 'react-redux';\n    import {Route, Router} from 'react-router';\n    import {history} from 'react-router/lib/BrowserHistory';\n    import {combineReducers, createStore} from 'redux';\n    import {reduxRouteComponent,\n            routerStateReducer as router} from 'redux-react-router';\n\n    import App from './components/App';\n\n\n    const reducer = combineReducers({\n      router: routerStateReducer,\n      // ...other reducers.\n    });\n    const store = createStore(reducer);\n\nNext, imagine that ```App``` is our root-level handler component.

What A-Frame brings to\nthe game is that it is based off an [entity-component system][ecs], a pattern\nused by universal game engines like [Unity][Unity] which favors composability\nover inheritance. As we'll see, this makes A-Frame extremely extendable.\n\nAnd A-Frame VR is extremely mindful of how to start a developer ecosystem.\nThere are [tools, tutorials, guides, boilerplates, libraries][awesome] being\nbuilt and knowledge being readily shared on [Slack][Slack].\n\n---\n\n## Entity-Component System\n\nThe [entity-component system][ecs] is a pattern in which every entity, or\nobject, in a scene are general placeholders. Then components are used to add\nappearance, behavior, and functionality. They're bags of logic and data that\ncan be applied to any entity, and they can be defined to just about do\n*anything*, and anyone can easily develop and share their components.  To\nimagine this visually, let's revisit this image:\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/kFLzzPC.png)\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nA good diagram for imagining what an entity looks like.\n</span></div>\n\nAn entity, by itself without components, doesn't render or do anything. A-Frame\nships with over 15 basic components. We can add a [geometry\ncomponent][geometry] to give it shape, a [material component][material] to give\nit appearance, or a [light component][light] and [sound component][sound] to\nhave it emit light or sound.\n\nEach component has properties that further defines how it modifies the entity.\nAnd components can be mixed and matched at will, hence the \"composable\" word\nroot of \"component\". In traditional terms, they can be thought of as plugins.\nAnd anyone can write them to do anything, even *explode* an entity. They are\nexpected to become an integral part of the workflow of building advanced\nscenes.\n\n### Writing and Sharing Components\n\nSo at what point does the promise of the ecosystem come in? A component is\nsimply **a plain JavaScript object** that defines several [lifecycle\nhandlers][lifecycle] that manages the component's data. Here are some\nexample third-party components that I and other people have written:\n\n- [Text component][component-text]\n- [Layout component][component-layout]\n- [Explode component][component-explode]\n- [Spawner component][component-spawner]\n- [Extrude and lathe component][component-extrude]\n\nSmall components can be as little as a few lines of code. Under the hood, they\neither do three.js object or JavaScript DOM manipulations. I will go into more\ndetail how to write a component at a later date, but to get started building a\nsharable component, check out the [component boilerplate][boilerplate].\n\n## Comparison with Other 3DMLs\n\nOther 3DMLs, or any markup languages at all for that matter, are based on an\ninheritance pattern. This is sort of the default pattern to go towards given\nthe heirarchichal nature of HTML and XML. Even A-Frame was initially built in\nthis way. The problem is that this lacks composability. Customizing objects to\ndo something more than basic becomes difficult, both to the user and to the\nlibrary developer.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/A98j4uM.png)\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nDifficulty of extending traditional objects in 3DML.\n</span></div>\n\nThe functionality of the language then becomes dependent on how many features\nthe maintainers and the library add. With A-Frame however, composability brings\nabout limitless functionality:\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/5SYtEZS.jpg)\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nComposability makes it easy to extend objects in A-Frame.\n</span></div>\n\nPutting it logically, the different kinds of functionality you can squeeze out\nof an object is the permutation of the number of components you have. With the\nbasic 16 components that A-Frame comes with, that's 65536 different sets of\ncomponents that could be used. Add in the fact that components can be further\ncustomized with properties, and that there is an ecosystem of components to tap\ninto, the previous use of the word \"limitless\" was quite literal.\n\nWith other 3DML libraries, if they ship 50 different kinds of objects, then you\nget only get 50 different kinds of objects with fixed behavior.\n","source":"_posts/090_aframe_different.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"How A-Frame VR is Different from Other 3D Markup Languages\"\ntype: blog\ncategory: blog\ndate: 2015-12-21\nid: aframe-vs-3dml\ntags: [code]\n\nimage:\n  url: http://i.imgur.com/kFLzzPC.png\n  caption: Rough diagram of the A-Frame entity-component system.\n---\n\n[awesome]: https://github.com/aframevr/awesome-aframe\n[X3Dom]: http://www.x3dom.org\n[GLAM]: http://tparisi.github.io/glam\n[Unity]: https://unity3d.com\n[NPM]: https://npmjs.com\n[Slack]: https://aframevr-slack.herokuapp.com/\n[geometry]: https://aframe.io/docs/components/geometry.html\n[material]: https://aframe.io/docs/components/material.html\n[light]: https://aframe.io/docs/components/light.html\n[sound]: https://aframe.io/docs/components/sound.html\n[lifecycle]: https://aframe.io/docs/core/component.html#Component_Definition_and_Lifecycle\n[component-text]: https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-text-component\n[component-layout]: https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-layout-component\n[component-explode]: https://github.com/dmarcos/a-invaders/blob/master/js/components/explode.js\n[component-spawner]: https://github.com/dmarcos/a-invaders/blob/master/js/components/spawner.js\n[component-extrude]: https://github.com/JosePedroDias/aframe-extrude-and-lathe\n[boilerplate]: https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-component-boilerplate\n[ecs]: https://aframe.io/docs/core/\n\nUpon first seeing A-Frame, branded as \"building blocks for the web\" displaying\nmarkup like `<a-cube>`, developers may conceive A-Frame as yet another 3DML (3D\nmarkup language) such as [X3Dom][X3Dom] or [GLAM][GLAM].

A component is\nsimply **a plain JavaScript object** that defines several [lifecycle\nhandlers][lifecycle] that manages the component's data. Here are some\nexample third-party components that I and other people have written:\n\n- [Text component][component-text]\n- [Layout component][component-layout]\n- [Explode component][component-explode]\n- [Spawner component][component-spawner]\n- [Extrude and lathe component][component-extrude]\n\nSmall components can be as little as a few lines of code. Under the hood, they\neither do three.js object or JavaScript DOM manipulations. I will go into more\ndetail how to write a component at a later date, but to get started building a\nsharable component, check out the [component boilerplate][boilerplate].\n\n## Comparison with Other 3DMLs\n\nOther 3DMLs, or any markup languages at all for that matter, are based on an\ninheritance pattern. This is sort of the default pattern to go towards given\nthe heirarchichal nature of HTML and XML. Even A-Frame was initially built in\nthis way. The problem is that this lacks composability.

It's called [A-Frame](http://aframe.io). A-Frame\nwraps three.js into custom elements so the HTML and DOM manipulations that web\ndevelopers are accustomed to can be used to create 3D VR scenes in the\nbrowser. Under the hood, A-Frame brings the [entity component\nsystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system), a pattern\ncommon in game development, to the DOM. It supports both desktop, if you got a\nRift, or easier, you can even use a smartphone. This post serves as a\nspeed-through introduction of A-Frame, refer the\n[documentation](http://aframe.io/docs) at any time for much more detail.\n\n---\n\nA-Frame, like the video games that have influenced all of us, ships at a\nseveral difficulty levels. We'll journey all the way from the comfortable bed\nof hierarchical HTML, through the jungles of the core entity-component system,\nand finally scale the walls of integration with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/tf9DteR.png)\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\n  Check out A-Frame stylin' with the DevTools.\n</span></div>\n\n## Enabling WebVR\n\nAt time of writing, to view the scenes in VR:\n\n- On desktop, get Firefox Developer Edition or Firefox Nightly, and install the\n  [WebVR Enabler Add-on][addon]. To use with an Oculus Rift DK2, have the Oculus\n  runtime installed (0.5.x for OS X).\n- On mobile, just open any A-Frame site using your phone browser (e.g., Firefox\n  for iOS, Firefox for Android, Chrome for Android, Safari for iOS).\n\n## \"Piece of Cake\" Difficulty - Codepen\n\nFor those that just want to play around with A-Frame immediately, check out the\n[example on Codepen][codepen]. Codepen lets you edit code in the browser and\nimmediately see the result. You'll see a scene that currenty looks something\nlike this:\n\n![A-Frame Codepen](http://i.imgur.com/4uSINKZ.png)\n\nWith the introductory Codepen examples, we are exposing a very high-level\nabstraction on top of A-Frame, using templated primitives, to ease developers\ninto the entity-component system. So this should be fairly readable to most. Now\nwhat do we do with this?  Click on the Goggles icon to view in VR. And try\nmodifying some values and see the scene change live.\n\n- Try changing the color of the cube (e.g., `color=\"#748B9C\"` for a rainy day blue).\n- Try changing the size of the sphere (e.g., `radius=\"0.25\"` to make it a little baby sphere).\n- Try changing the position of the cylinder (e.g., `position=\"1 1 1\"` to raise the roof).\n\nAs amazing as that was, a Codepen is still a pen. The ambitions of VR are not\nsuitable for being fenced in. Like the Kool-Aid Man, we must break out of the\nconfinements of a coding playground.\n\n## \"Let's Rock\" Difficulty - Boilerplate\n\nFor beginners that want to start playing with some toy scenes locally and hacking away,\ncheck out the basic [A-Frame boilerplate](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-boilerplate).\nBoilerplate refers to pre-written reusable code that can be made your own with\nminimal modification.\n\nNote that I say this intended for beginners because it focuses on using the\ntemplated primitives abstraction and hides away the underlying engine. For\ndevelopers that want to get their hands dirty, I would skip this and move\ndirectly to the entity-component system.\n\nThe boilerplate provides the same code found in the Codepen above, but also can\nbe downloaded as a ZIP package or forked on Github. Once you have the code on\nyour machine, just modify it in your favorite text editor and fire it up in the\nbrowser.\n\n## \"Come Get Some\" Difficulty - Primitives\n\nFor those that want to start writing scenes from scratch in vanilla HTML, check\nout A-Frame's [pre-built primitive](https://aframe.io/docs/primitives/).\n\nA \"primitive\" in computer graphics is a basic building block like a cube or a\nsphere. They are:\n\n- Are pre-fabricated custom elements like `<a-cube>` or `<a-sphere>` that combine\n  recipes of components to achieve the intended result.\n- Are a convenience and usability wrapper on top of the underlying entity-component system.\n- Are much cleaner in syntax but are less flexible and composable than using the\n  entity-component system directly.\n\nFor example, rather than having:\n\n    ::html\n    <a-scene>\n      <a-entity>\n        <a-entity camera look-controls wasd-controls></a-entity>\n      </a-entity>\n      <a-entity geometry=\"primitive: box; depth: 1; height: 1; width: 1\" material=\"color: red\">\n      </a-entity>\n    </a-scene>\n\nTemplates wrap the entity into something more concise:\n\n    ::html\n    <a-scene>\n      <a-cube color=\"red\" depth=\"1\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"></a-cube>\n    </a-scene>\n\nAnyone can create their own templates since they are just defined in HTML.\nLet's reveal the definition of `<a-cube>`:\n\n    ::html\n    <template is=\"a-template\"\n              element=\"a-cube\"\n              width=\"1.5\"\n              height=\"1.5\"\n              depth=\"1.5\"\n              translate=\"0 0 0\"\n              color=\"gray\"\n              opacity=\"1.0\"\n              shader=\"standard\"\n              transparent=\"true\"\n              metalness=\"0.0\"\n              roughness=\"0.5\"\n              src=\"\">\n      <a-entity geometry=\"primitive: box;\n                          width: ${width};\n                          height: ${height};\n                          depth: ${depth};\n                          translate: ${translate}\"\n                material=\"color: ${color};\n                          opacity: ${opacity};\n                          shader: ${shader};\n                          transparent: ${transparent};\n                          metalness: ${metalness};\n                          roughness: ${roughness};\n                          src: url(${src})\"></a-entity>\n    </template>\n\n`<a-cube>` wraps a single entity (with the `geometry.primitive=box`) and\nexposes a few component attributes as HTML attributes. Don't worry about the\nattributes that seem unfamiliar, we will go over some of them later and point\nto the comprehensive documentation.\n\nA-Frame also has [an animation system](http://aframe.io/docs/core/animation.html). Let's try\nmakng the cube rotate indefinitely. The animation system also works with the core system,\nnot just templates.\n\n    ::html\n    <a-scene>\n      <a-cube color=\"red\" depth=\"1\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">\n        <a-animation attribute=\"rotation\" repeat=\"indefinite\" to=\"0 360 360\"></a-animation>\n      </a-cube>\n    </a-scene>\n\n### Caveats\n\nTemplates *may* be subject to flux such as reimplementation or modularization\ninto a different repository. From a technical standpoint, A-Frame templates and\nprimitives are somewhat immature and less flexible, but from a product standpoint,\nthey are more usable and less exotic to newer users of A-Frame. For full flexbility,\nwe have to dig deeper.\n\n## \"Damn I'm Good\" Difficulty - Entity-Component System\n\nFor those that want to be unleashed into the full promised power, flexibility,\nand composability of A-Frame, we can finally end the hand-waving and check out\nthe [core entity-component system](http://aframe.io/docs/core/).\n\nDespite having been abstracted away from the aforementioned templates, A-Frame is built on an\nentity-component system. Entities are general purpose placeholder objects.\nComponents modify the appearance, behavior, or functionality of the entities.\nAnd every object in the scene is an entity whether it be the player, a tree, a\nmonster, the sky, a sound, lights. Components can be mixed and matched,\ncomposed and overridden. A-Frame comes with a bunch of components, and anyone\ncan write their own components to have objects look however or do whatever\nthey want. Check out all of the [shipped components](http://aframe.io/docs/components/),\nand check out some third-party custom components at [awesome-aframe][awesome-aframe].\n\nLet's start with a blank entity:\n\n    ::html\n    <a-entity></a-entity>\n\nBy default, this lonely entity inherently only has a position, rotation, and\nscale in the scene. Without any other components, nothing will render on the\nscene. Let's change that, giving it a geometry (shape) and material (appearance).\n\n    ::html\n    <a-entity geometry=\"primitive: sphere\" material=\"color: red\"></a-entity>\n\nNow we should be seeing something. But why stop there? Let's make it emit light on other\nentities.\n\n    ::html\n    <a-entity geometry=\"primitive: sphere\" material=\"color: red\"\n              light=\"type: point; intensity: 2\"></a-entity>\n\nLet's have it stare at the camera.\n\n    ::html\n    <a-entity geometry=\"primitive: sphere\" material=\"color: red\"\n              light=\"type: point; intensity: 2\" look-at=\"[camera]\"></a-entity>\n\nLet's have it emit sound.\n\n    ::html\n    <a-entity geometry=\"primitive: sphere\" material=\"color: red\"\n              light=\"type: point; intensity: 2\" look-at=\"[camera]\"\n              sound=\"src: squeak.mp3\"></a-entity>\n\nThere are all of these components that can customize our entities. And all\nthese attributes that can customize our components. And anyone can [write their\nown components][write-components], having free reign to add any behavior they\ncan imagine. Some components we might write include a layout component, a\nvibrate component, a cloner component, an explode component, a set-on-fire\ncomponent. I am very excited to see what people come up with.\n\nThe raw entity-component system is what we consider low-level. But all\nlow-level things are made to be abstracted. Bring on the hot trend of 2015,\nReact.\n\n## \"Born to be Wild\" Difficulty - React\n\nNote that A-Frame + React integration is experimental and is currently my\npersonal project. I haven't yet stress-tested possible performance limitations\nthat the Virtual DOM may introduce. [react-three](https://github.com/Izzimach/react-three),\nanother React library on top of three.js, had limitations because each object\nintroduced its own `requestAnimationFrame`. React + A-Frame does not have those kinds of\nlimitations.\n\nReact is a great fit with A-Frame now that React v0.14 accepts custom\nattributes.  I gave it a shot and within an hour, I developed a [library\nintegrating A-Frame and React][aframe-react] and [a boilerplate featuring\naframe-react and Webpack][aframe-react-boilerplate].\n\nWhy does React work so well with A-Frame?\n\n- A-Frame is already based on custom elements. It does not take much to wrap it with React.\n- Reactive updates and data binding vastly reduces the amount of manual DOM manipulation.\n- The React ecosystem with NPM provides a great way for sharing A-Frame templates, mixins,\n  and components.\n- Redux can then be layered on to provide statefulness to the application which will be\n  great for editors and tooling.\n- Event handling is easier as we can just set event handler functions as props on\n  our A-Frame/React components.\n- `props` makes it easy to extend and compose A-Frame component data, making A-Frame\n  mixins completely obsolete.\n- With Babel, a standard tool for transpiling React, giving object rest/spread properties\n  and templating strings, passing down components are easy and concise.\n\nHere's an [example scene][react-scene] where clicking a spinning cube changes its color.\n\n    ::js\n    class ExampleScene extends React.Component {\n      constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n        this.state = {\n          color: 'red'\n        }\n      }\n\n      changeColor = () => {\n        const colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue'];\n        this.setState({\n          color: colors[Math.floor(Math.random() * colors.length)],\n        });\n      }\n\n      render () {\n        return (\n          <Scene>\n            <Camera><Cursor/></Camera>\n\n            <Sky/>\n\n            <Light type=\"ambient\" color=\"#888\"/>\n            <Light type=\"directional\" intensity=\"0.5\" position=\"-1 1 0\"/>\n            <Light type=\"directional\" intensity=\"1\" position=\"1 1 0\"/>\n\n            <Entity geometry=\"primitive: box\" material={{color: this.state.color}}\n                    onClick={this.changeColor}\n                    position=\"0 0 -5\">\n              <Animation attribute=\"rotation\" dur=\"5000\" repeat=\"indefinite\" to=\"0 360 360\"/>\n            </Entity>\n          </Scene>\n        );\n      }\n    }\n\nUsing React provides the best of all the worlds. The conciseness of A-Frame\ntemplates, the power of the A-Frame core system, and the ecosystem of NPM. The\nscene here is pretty concise and easy to read.\n\nTo demonstrate how easy it is to create React components, here is the definition\nfor a dumb `<Light>` using a stateless React component:\n\n    ::js\n    export default const Light = props => {\n      return <Entity light={...props}></Entity>;\n    };\n\nI imagine, with the current state of web development, that people will enjoy\nthis. I know I will.\n\n## Behind the Scenes - Developing A-Frame\n\nGetting more into personal notes, I have been contributing to MozVR and A-Frame over the last\ncouple months, working on the core entity-component pieces of the system at\n[A-Frame Core](http://github.com/aframevr/aframe-core).

It's called [A-Frame](http://aframe.io). A-Frame\nwraps three.js into custom elements so the HTML and DOM manipulations that web\ndevelopers are accustomed to can be used to create 3D VR scenes in the\nbrowser. Under the hood, A-Frame brings the [entity component\nsystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system), a pattern\ncommon in game development, to the DOM. It supports both desktop, if you got a\nRift, or easier, you can even use a smartphone. This post serves as a\nspeed-through introduction of A-Frame, refer the\n[documentation](http://aframe.io/docs) at any time for much more detail.\n\n---\n\nA-Frame, like the video games that have influenced all of us, ships at a\nseveral difficulty levels. We'll journey all the way from the comfortable bed\nof hierarchical HTML, through the jungles of the core entity-component system,\nand finally scale the walls of integration with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/tf9DteR.png)\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\n  Check out A-Frame stylin' with the DevTools.\n</span></div>\n\n## Enabling WebVR\n\nAt time of writing, to view the scenes in VR:\n\n- On desktop, get Firefox Developer Edition or Firefox Nightly, and install the\n  [WebVR Enabler Add-on][addon]. To use with an Oculus Rift DK2, have the Oculus\n  runtime installed (0.5.x for OS X).\n- On mobile, just open any A-Frame site using your phone browser (e.g., Firefox\n  for iOS, Firefox for Android, Chrome for Android, Safari for iOS).\n\n## \"Piece of Cake\" Difficulty - Codepen\n\nFor those that just want to play around with A-Frame immediately, check out the\n[example on Codepen][codepen]. Codepen lets you edit code in the browser and\nimmediately see the result. You'll see a scene that currenty looks something\nlike this:\n\n![A-Frame Codepen](http://i.imgur.com/4uSINKZ.png)\n\nWith the introductory Codepen examples, we are exposing a very high-level\nabstraction on top of A-Frame, using templated primitives, to ease developers\ninto the entity-component system. So this should be fairly readable to most. Now\nwhat do we do with this?  Click on the Goggles icon to view in VR. And try\nmodifying some values and see the scene change live.\n\n- Try changing the color of the cube (e.g., `color=\"#748B9C\"` for a rainy day blue).\n- Try changing the size of the sphere (e.g., `radius=\"0.25\"` to make it a little baby sphere).\n- Try changing the position of the cylinder (e.g., `position=\"1 1 1\"` to raise the roof).\n\nAs amazing as that was, a Codepen is still a pen. The ambitions of VR are not\nsuitable for being fenced in. Like the Kool-Aid Man, we must break out of the\nconfinements of a coding playground.\n\n## \"Let's Rock\" Difficulty - Boilerplate\n\nFor beginners that want to start playing with some toy scenes locally and hacking away,\ncheck out the basic [A-Frame boilerplate](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-boilerplate).\nBoilerplate refers to pre-written reusable code that can be made your own with\nminimal modification.\n\nNote that I say this intended for beginners because it focuses on using the\ntemplated primitives abstraction and hides away the underlying engine. For\ndevelopers that want to get their hands dirty, I would skip this and move\ndirectly to the entity-component system.\n\nThe boilerplate provides the same code found in the Codepen above, but also can\nbe downloaded as a ZIP package or forked on Github. Once you have the code on\nyour machine, just modify it in your favorite text editor and fire it up in the\nbrowser.\n\n## \"Come Get Some\" Difficulty - Primitives\n\nFor those that want to start writing scenes from scratch in vanilla HTML, check\nout A-Frame's [pre-built primitive](https://aframe.io/docs/primitives/).\n\nA \"primitive\" in computer graphics is a basic building block like a cube or a\nsphere. They are:\n\n- Are pre-fabricated custom elements like `<a-cube>` or `<a-sphere>` that combine\n  recipes of components to achieve the intended result.\n- Are a convenience and usability wrapper on top of the underlying entity-component system.\n- Are much cleaner in syntax but are less flexible and composable than using the\n  entity-component system directly.\n\nFor example, rather than having:\n\n    ::html\n    <a-scene>\n      <a-entity>\n        <a-entity camera look-controls wasd-controls></a-entity>\n      </a-entity>\n      <a-entity geometry=\"primitive: box; depth: 1; height: 1; width: 1\" material=\"color: red\">\n      </a-entity>\n    </a-scene>\n\nTemplates wrap the entity into something more concise:\n\n    ::html\n    <a-scene>\n      <a-cube color=\"red\" depth=\"1\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"></a-cube>\n    </a-scene>\n\nAnyone can create their own templates since they are just defined in HTML.\nLet's reveal the definition of `<a-cube>`:\n\n    ::html\n    <template is=\"a-template\"\n              element=\"a-cube\"\n              width=\"1.5\"\n              height=\"1.5\"\n              depth=\"1.5\"\n              translate=\"0 0 0\"\n              color=\"gray\"\n              opacity=\"1.0\"\n              shader=\"standard\"\n              transparent=\"true\"\n              metalness=\"0.0\"\n              roughness=\"0.5\"\n              src=\"\">\n      <a-entity geometry=\"primitive: box;\n                          width: ${width};\n                          height: ${height};\n                          depth: ${depth};\n                          translate: ${translate}\"\n                material=\"color: ${color};\n                          opacity: ${opacity};\n                          shader: ${shader};\n                          transparent: ${transparent};\n                          metalness: ${metalness};\n                          roughness: ${roughness};\n                          src: url(${src})\"></a-entity>\n    </template>\n\n`<a-cube>` wraps a single entity (with the `geometry.primitive=box`) and\nexposes a few component attributes as HTML attributes. Don't worry about the\nattributes that seem unfamiliar, we will go over some of them later and point\nto the comprehensive documentation.\n\nA-Frame also has [an animation system](http://aframe.io/docs/core/animation.html). Let's try\nmakng the cube rotate indefinitely. The animation system also works with the core system,\nnot just templates.\n\n    ::html\n    <a-scene>\n      <a-cube color=\"red\" depth=\"1\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\">\n        <a-animation attribute=\"rotation\" repeat=\"indefinite\" to=\"0 360 360\"></a-animation>\n      </a-cube>\n    </a-scene>\n\n### Caveats\n\nTemplates *may* be subject to flux such as reimplementation or modularization\ninto a different repository. From a technical standpoint, A-Frame templates and\nprimitives are somewhat immature and less flexible, but from a product standpoint,\nthey are more usable and less exotic to newer users of A-Frame. For full flexbility,\nwe have to dig deeper.\n\n## \"Damn I'm Good\" Difficulty - Entity-Component System\n\nFor those that want to be unleashed into the full promised power, flexibility,\nand composability of A-Frame, we can finally end the hand-waving and check out\nthe [core entity-component system](http://aframe.io/docs/core/).\n\nDespite having been abstracted away from the aforementioned templates, A-Frame is built on an\nentity-component system. Entities are general purpose placeholder objects.\nComponents modify the appearance, behavior, or functionality of the entities.\nAnd every object in the scene is an entity whether it be the player, a tree, a\nmonster, the sky, a sound, lights. Components can be mixed and matched,\ncomposed and overridden. A-Frame comes with a bunch of components, and anyone\ncan write their own components to have objects look however or do whatever\nthey want. Check out all of the [shipped components](http://aframe.io/docs/components/),\nand check out some third-party custom components at [awesome-aframe][awesome-aframe].\n\nLet's start with a blank entity:\n\n    ::html\n    <a-entity></a-entity>\n\nBy default, this lonely entity inherently only has a position, rotation, and\nscale in the scene. Without any other components, nothing will render on the\nscene. Let's change that, giving it a geometry (shape) and material (appearance).\n\n    ::html\n    <a-entity geometry=\"primitive: sphere\" material=\"color: red\"></a-entity>\n\nNow we should be seeing something. But why stop there? Let's make it emit light on other\nentities.\n\n    ::html\n    <a-entity geometry=\"primitive: sphere\" material=\"color: red\"\n              light=\"type: point; intensity: 2\"></a-entity>\n\nLet's have it stare at the camera.\n\n    ::html\n    <a-entity geometry=\"primitive: sphere\" material=\"color: red\"\n              light=\"type: point; intensity: 2\" look-at=\"[camera]\"></a-entity>\n\nLet's have it emit sound.\n\n    ::html\n    <a-entity geometry=\"primitive: sphere\" material=\"color: red\"\n              light=\"type: point; intensity: 2\" look-at=\"[camera]\"\n              sound=\"src: squeak.mp3\"></a-entity>\n\nThere are all of these components that can customize our entities. And all\nthese attributes that can customize our components. And anyone can [write their\nown components][write-components], having free reign to add any behavior they\ncan imagine. Some components we might write include a layout component, a\nvibrate component, a cloner component, an explode component, a set-on-fire\ncomponent. I am very excited to see what people come up with.\n\nThe raw entity-component system is what we consider low-level. But all\nlow-level things are made to be abstracted. Bring on the hot trend of 2015,\nReact.\n\n## \"Born to be Wild\" Difficulty - React\n\nNote that A-Frame + React integration is experimental and is currently my\npersonal project. I haven't yet stress-tested possible performance limitations\nthat the Virtual DOM may introduce. [react-three](https://github.com/Izzimach/react-three),\nanother React library on top of three.js, had limitations because each object\nintroduced its own `requestAnimationFrame`. React + A-Frame does not have those kinds of\nlimitations.\n\nReact is a great fit with A-Frame now that React v0.14 accepts custom\nattributes.  I gave it a shot and within an hour, I developed a [library\nintegrating A-Frame and React][aframe-react] and [a boilerplate featuring\naframe-react and Webpack][aframe-react-boilerplate].\n\nWhy does React work so well with A-Frame?\n\n- A-Frame is already based on custom elements.

Don’t worry about the\nattributes that seem unfamiliar, we will go over some of them later and point\nto the comprehensive documentation.</p>\n<p>A-Frame also has <a href=\"http://aframe.io/docs/core/animation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">an animation system</a>. Let’s try\nmakng the cube rotate indefinitely. The animation system also works with the core system,\nnot just templates.</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;a-scene&gt;\n  &lt;a-cube color=&quot;red&quot; depth=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;a-animation attribute=&quot;rotation&quot; repeat=&quot;indefinite&quot; to=&quot;0 360 360&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-animation&gt;\n  &lt;/a-cube&gt;\n&lt;/a-scene&gt;\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"Caveats\"><a href=\"#Caveats\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Caveats\"></a>Caveats</h3><p>Templates <em>may</em> be subject to flux such as reimplementation or modularization\ninto a different repository. From a technical standpoint, A-Frame templates and\nprimitives are somewhat immature and less flexible, but from a product standpoint,\nthey are more usable and less exotic to newer users of A-Frame. For full flexbility,\nwe have to dig deeper.</p>\n<h2 id=\"“Damn-I’m-Good”-Difficulty-Entity-Component-System\"><a href=\"#“Damn-I’m-Good”-Difficulty-Entity-Component-System\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"“Damn I’m Good” Difficulty - Entity-Component System\"></a>“Damn I’m Good” Difficulty - Entity-Component System</h2><p>For those that want to be unleashed into the full promised power, flexibility,\nand composability of A-Frame, we can finally end the hand-waving and check out\nthe <a href=\"http://aframe.io/docs/core/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">core entity-component system</a>.</p>\n<p>Despite having been abstracted away from the aforementioned templates, A-Frame is built on an\nentity-component system. Entities are general purpose placeholder objects.\nComponents modify the appearance, behavior, or functionality of the entities.\nAnd every object in the scene is an entity whether it be the player, a tree, a\nmonster, the sky, a sound, lights. Components can be mixed and matched,\ncomposed and overridden. A-Frame comes with a bunch of components, and anyone\ncan write their own components to have objects look however or do whatever\nthey want. Check out all of the <a href=\"http://aframe.io/docs/components/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">shipped components</a>,\nand check out some third-party custom components at <a href=\"http://github.com/aframevr/awesome-aframe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">awesome-aframe</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with a blank entity:</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;a-entity&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;\n</code></pre><p>By default, this lonely entity inherently only has a position, rotation, and\nscale in the scene. Without any other components, nothing will render on the\nscene. Let’s change that, giving it a geometry (shape) and material (appearance).</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;a-entity geometry=&quot;primitive: sphere&quot; material=&quot;color: red&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Now we should be seeing something. But why stop there? Let’s make it emit light on other\nentities.</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;a-entity geometry=&quot;primitive: sphere&quot; material=&quot;color: red&quot;\n          light=&quot;type: point; intensity: 2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Let’s have it stare at the camera.</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;a-entity geometry=&quot;primitive: sphere&quot; material=&quot;color: red&quot;\n          light=&quot;type: point; intensity: 2&quot; look-at=&quot;[camera]&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Let’s have it emit sound.</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;a-entity geometry=&quot;primitive: sphere&quot; material=&quot;color: red&quot;\n          light=&quot;type: point; intensity: 2&quot; look-at=&quot;[camera]&quot;\n          sound=&quot;src: squeak.mp3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;\n</code></pre><p>There are all of these components that can customize our entities. And all\nthese attributes that can customize our components. And anyone can <a href=\"http://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-component-boilerplate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">write their\nown components</a>, having free reign to add any behavior they\ncan imagine. Some components we might write include a layout component, a\nvibrate component, a cloner component, an explode component, a set-on-fire\ncomponent. I am very excited to see what people come up with.</p>\n<p>The raw entity-component system is what we consider low-level. But all\nlow-level things are made to be abstracted. Bring on the hot trend of 2015,\nReact.</p>\n<h2 id=\"“Born-to-be-Wild”-Difficulty-React\"><a href=\"#“Born-to-be-Wild”-Difficulty-React\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"“Born to be Wild” Difficulty - React\"></a>“Born to be Wild” Difficulty - React</h2><p>Note that A-Frame + React integration is experimental and is currently my\npersonal project. I haven’t yet stress-tested possible performance limitations\nthat the Virtual DOM may introduce. <a href=\"https://github.com/Izzimach/react-three\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">react-three</a>,\nanother React library on top of three.js, had limitations because each object\nintroduced its own <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>. React + A-Frame does not have those kinds of\nlimitations.</p>\n<p>React is a great fit with A-Frame now that React v0.14 accepts custom\nattributes.  I gave it a shot and within an hour, I developed a <a href=\"http://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-react\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">library\nintegrating A-Frame and React</a> and <a href=\"http://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-react-boilerplate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">a boilerplate featuring\naframe-react and Webpack</a>.</p>\n<p>Why does React work so well with A-Frame?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A-Frame is already based on custom elements. It does not take much to wrap it with React.</li>\n<li>Reactive updates and data binding vastly reduces the amount of manual DOM manipulation.</li>\n<li>The React ecosystem with NPM provides a great way for sharing A-Frame templates, mixins,\nand components.</li>\n<li>Redux can then be layered on to provide statefulness to the application which will be\ngreat for editors and tooling.</li>\n<li>Event handling is easier as we can just set event handler functions as props on\nour A-Frame/React components.</li>\n<li><code>props</code> makes it easy to extend and compose A-Frame component data, making A-Frame\nmixins completely obsolete.</li>\n<li>With Babel, a standard tool for transpiling React, giving object rest/spread properties\nand templating strings, passing down components are easy and concise.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here’s an <a href=\"http://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-react-boilerplate/tree/master/src/js/app.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">example scene</a> where clicking a spinning cube changes its color.</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nclass ExampleScene extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      color: &apos;red&apos;\n    }\n  }\n\n  changeColor = () =&gt; {\n    const colors = [&apos;red&apos;, &apos;orange&apos;, &apos;yellow&apos;, &apos;green&apos;, &apos;blue&apos;];\n    this.setState({\n      color: colors[Math.floor(Math.random() * colors.length)],\n    });\n  }\n\n  render () {\n    return (\n      &lt;Scene&gt;\n        &lt;Camera&gt;&lt;Cursor/&gt;&lt;/Camera&gt;\n\n        &lt;Sky/&gt;\n\n        &lt;Light type=&quot;ambient&quot; color=&quot;#888&quot;/&gt;\n        &lt;Light type=&quot;directional&quot; intensity=&quot;0.5&quot; position=&quot;-1 1 0&quot;/&gt;\n        &lt;Light type=&quot;directional&quot; intensity=&quot;1&quot; position=&quot;1 1 0&quot;/&gt;\n\n        &lt;Entity geometry=&quot;primitive: box&quot; material={{color: this.state.color}}\n                onClick={this.changeColor}\n                position=&quot;0 0 -5&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;Animation attribute=&quot;rotation&quot; dur=&quot;5000&quot; repeat=&quot;indefinite&quot; to=&quot;0 360 360&quot;/&gt;\n        &lt;/Entity&gt;\n      &lt;/Scene&gt;\n    );\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>Using React provides the best of all the worlds. The conciseness of A-Frame\ntemplates, the power of the A-Frame core system, and the ecosystem of NPM. The\nscene here is pretty concise and easy to read.</p>\n<p>To demonstrate how easy it is to create React components, here is the definition\nfor a dumb <code>&lt;Light&gt;</code> using a stateless React component:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nexport default const Light = props =&gt; {\n  return &lt;Entity light={...props}&gt;&lt;/Entity&gt;;\n};\n</code></pre><p>I imagine, with the current state of web development, that people will enjoy\nthis. I know I will.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Behind-the-Scenes-Developing-A-Frame\"><a href=\"#Behind-the-Scenes-Developing-A-Frame\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Behind the Scenes - Developing A-Frame\"></a>Behind the Scenes - Developing A-Frame</h2><p>Getting more into personal notes, I have been contributing to MozVR and A-Frame over the last\ncouple months, working on the core entity-component pieces of the system at\n<a href=\"http://github.com/aframevr/aframe-core\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">A-Frame Core</a>. With Firefox OS\nsmartphones having “fallen” and with my previous team as well as dissolved,\nworking in 3D and VR has been immensely exciting. To catch up, I have had to\nread and take notes about design, brush up on my linear alegbra, and dive into\nthe world of 3D rendering. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/dp/1452654123\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">The Design of Everything Things</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.realtimerendering.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Real-Time Rendering</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Primer-Graphics-Development-Wordware-Library/dp/1556229119\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">3D Math Primer</a>,\n<a href=\"https://37signals.com/rework/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Rework</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Virtual-Reality-Insider-Guidebook-Industry/dp/0990999920\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Virtual Reality Insider</a>\nwere all books that came in handy.</p>\n<p>The hardest thing about developing on A-Frame was feeling out the target\naudience. Should this be for beginners, for everyone and their grandma, for\nnovices, for seasoned developers? I still don’t feel it’s been quite resolved.\nIt’s a question that has driven a lot of debates with the API design and\nmessaging. One instance of contention was the naming of <code>&lt;a-entity&gt;</code> vs. the\nformer <code>&lt;a-object&gt;</code>. Or whether or not to hide the entity-component system\nbehind templates and primitives such that A-Frame does not seem too exotic.</p>\n<p>The most fun thing about developing on A-Frame was how much there was to learn\nand discover. I was just about to hit a ceiling on the Firefox Marketplace\nteam; after taking the whole React and Redux journey and absorbing everything,\nI had well outgrown the project (well, especially since it was dying). Jumping\ninto 3D and VR, I accumulated <a href=\"http://nattyornot.com/bodybuilding-basics-noob-gains-explained/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">noob\ngains</a> on 3D\ndevelopment, rendering, game development patterns, and API design. And working\nwith a team in-person rather than remotely was refreshing</p>\n<p>And there’s more to discover like what standard VR interactions will form and\nwhat will VR web browsing look like? It’s imagining a future that hasn’t come.\nY’all remember bring your A-Frame.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Further-Resources\"><a href=\"#Further-Resources\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Further Resources\"></a>Further Resources</h2><ul>\n<li>Check out the <a href=\"http://aframe.io/docs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">official docs</a>.</li>\n<li>Connect with us and the community on the <a href=\"http://aframevr.slack.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">A-Frame Slack channel</a>.</li>\n<li>See a community-populated list of resources at <a href=\"http://github.com/aframevr/awesome-aframe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">awesome-aframe</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n","site":{"data":{}},"excerpt":"","more":"<p>Today, the Mozilla virtual reality team (<a href=\"http://mozvr.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">MozVR</a>)\nreleased an open-source library for beginners and developers alike to easily\ncreate WebVR experiences.

With Firefox OS\nsmartphones having “fallen” and with my previous team as well as dissolved,\nworking in 3D and VR has been immensely exciting. To catch up, I have had to\nread and take notes about design, brush up on my linear alegbra, and dive into\nthe world of 3D rendering. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/dp/1452654123\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">The Design of Everything Things</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.realtimerendering.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Real-Time Rendering</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Primer-Graphics-Development-Wordware-Library/dp/1556229119\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">3D Math Primer</a>,\n<a href=\"https://37signals.com/rework/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Rework</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Virtual-Reality-Insider-Guidebook-Industry/dp/0990999920\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Virtual Reality Insider</a>\nwere all books that came in handy.</p>\n<p>The hardest thing about developing on A-Frame was feeling out the target\naudience. Should this be for beginners, for everyone and their grandma, for\nnovices, for seasoned developers? I still don’t feel it’s been quite resolved.\nIt’s a question that has driven a lot of debates with the API design and\nmessaging. One instance of contention was the naming of <code>&lt;a-entity&gt;</code> vs. the\nformer <code>&lt;a-object&gt;</code>. Or whether or not to hide the entity-component system\nbehind templates and primitives such that A-Frame does not seem too exotic.</p>\n<p>The most fun thing about developing on A-Frame was how much there was to learn\nand discover. I was just about to hit a ceiling on the Firefox Marketplace\nteam; after taking the whole React and Redux journey and absorbing everything,\nI had well outgrown the project (well, especially since it was dying).

The Ricoh Theta S is a freshly released camera featuring two 180-degree\nwide-angle lens that can take 360-degree (equirectangular) photos with a single\nexposure or button press, opening up immersive 360-degree photography to the\nmasses. With most familiar only with flat 2D photography, there is a completely\ndifferent workflow to adapt to. Taking the Theta to the streets of Mong\nKok, the most population-dense area and literally the busiest district in the\nworld, here is what I learned about 360-degree shooting workflow and composition.\n\n---\n\n## About the Ricoh Theta S\n\nThe Ricoh Theta S is the successor to the Ricoh Theta, featuring improvements\nacross the board just crossing the line of producing usable images. Quick rundown of the\ntechnical specs:\n\n- Two 180-degree fisheye lens (f2)\n- 12-megapixel JPEG images (4200x2800)\n- Remote connectivity through Wi-Fi with [Android][android] and [iOS][ios] app\n- Manual exposure capability (though aperture is fixed at f2)\n- Low quality video capability including audio (30fps, upscaled 1920x1080)\n\nIt retails at $350. Given the specs, it is an expensive toy for enthusiasts and\nearly adopters\n\n## Shooting Workflow\n\nHere's what I learned about shooting the camera itself, the physical aspects.\n\n### Remote Shutter is Mandatory\n\nIf you handhold the camera, your hand will be very prominent on the lower half\nof the 360-degree image. The shutter button is situated underneath the lens,\nand there is no way to hide your hand while pressing the button. Unfortunately,\nthe Theta S does not have a built-in timer capability.\n\nSo you must use the Android or iOS apps (linked above) to trigger the shutter\nremotely. Install the app, make sure Wi-Fi is not switched off on the camera,\nconnect to the camera via Wi-Fi (the password is on the bottom of the camera),\nand launch the app. You can get a (choppy) live view of the image from the app\nas well.\n\n### Tripod is Mandatory\n\nWe can shooting remotely, but we need a tripod to hold the camera without\nfilling up the shot. The Theta *can* stand up by itself, but placing it\non a flat surface will cause the surface to take up a lot of the shot. A\ntripod, being a stick, won't take up as much room.\n\nIt also allows complete freedom to compose the shot. And it allows us to hold\nthe camera well above head-level.\n\nI use the [Sony VCT-R100 Tripod][tripod]. It's cheap, lightweight, very\nadjustable, and folds up small enough to fit comfortably into a messenger bag.\nThe pan handle is also useful as a hook to carry the tripod around hands-free.\nIt's useful for holding above head or placing on the ground.\n\nFor a tripod purely for walkaround street photography, I'd also consider\nthe [Pedco Ultrapod II][tripod2], to be very discreet. Although it is less\nversatile than having a tripod that can go to full height.\n\n### Exposure Settings\n\nThe Theta has auto, shutter priority, ISO priority, and manual modes.\nThe aperture is fixed at f2. I switch between shutter speed and ISO priority\ndepending on the situation.\n\nI mainly shoot ISO priority as it leaves less guesswork. During the day, I\nmight use about 200-400 ISO just to make sure I get a good shutter speed.\nDuring the night, if the scene had no moving subjects and the camera was on a\nstable tripod, I might use ISO 100 to get reduce noise.\n\nShooting shutter speed priority has bitten me. During the day, I tried to set\n1/80 maximum shutter speed and everything was blown out. It's hard to guess\nwhat the minimum shutter speed is so using ISO priority at a low setting\nensures getting that minimum shutter speed.\n\n### Review Images Often\n\nThere is less instant feedback when shooting with the Theta since there is no\nLCD on the camera. Images must be transferred over Wi-Fi which can take several seconds.\nAnd using the app, it is often too much of a hassle to go to image viewing mode\nand then back to shooting mode.\n\nBut every once in a while, make sure to chimp on your images to make sure the\nexposure settings are correct. Especially when learning to use the camera, it\nalso helps to check if the composition looks good. It can be surprising with\nthe wide-angle lens how much it stretches perspective.\n\n### Handling\n\nI found some tips on handling the Theta you will want to know about:\n\n- The Theta goes to sleep after a while. The LED above the shutter will\nblink. To wake it up, just press the shutter button.\n- The Wi-Fi server on the camera takes a few seconds to boot up. So try to leave\nit on while you are shooting or carrying it around. This probably affects\nbattery life, so bring along some USB battery packs. The Theta might\nlast only about half a day.\n- Just turn off live view in shooting mode. Turning it off reduces\nshutter lag, probably saves battery life, and the feed is too choppy and grainy\nto be useful anyways.\n- The app will also sometimes become unresponsive so you will have to restart it.\n- Turning on noise reduction immensely improves image quality.\n- Keep the cover on when not in use. It's bound to get scratched or dropped.\n- Don't seriously use the video function. 30FPS at less-than-HD quality is\npretty useless for consumption.\n\n### Shooting Alongside a Regular Camera\n\nIf you're out on a shoot, you will probably still want to pack your regular\ncamera alongside the Theta. It will be difficult to wield your regular camera\nalong with a tripod with the Theta attached.\n\nI *heavily* recommend the [Capture Camera Clip][clip]. The Capture allows you\nto holster the camera on a belt or strap. This allows you to carry a camera\nhands-free when not in use, without any annoying camera straps. It's secure; I\ncarry my Pentax K3 on my hip even in tight subways in China without worrying\nabout getting it swiped.\n\nI also recommend getting a tripod head with a quick-release plate. With the\nTheta on a quick release plate, and the Capture being compatible with\nquick-release plates, you can switch on the tripod between the Theta and\nregular camera rapidly without having to spend time screwing around (pun\nintended). I got a quick-release tripod ball head in Mong Kok for $40!\n\n## Composition\n\nHere's what I learned about shooting 360-degree photography overall, the mental aspects.\n\n### What You See is What You Get\n\nTraditionally with wide-angle lenses, the perspective is dramatically\nstretched. The foreground will appear very close, and the background will\nappear very far. In normal photography, it would be important to get close to\nthe subject else everything would seem very far.\n\nWith 360 photography however since the resulting image will be wrapped around a\nsphere rather than displayed on a 2D plane, the perspective will appear like\nwhat you see with your own eyes in real life. Thus, what you see when you take\na shot with the Theta is what you get.\n\n### Height Level for Immersion\n\nBe mindful about how people will view your image. Mostly likely, they will\neither be standing up, or sitting down. For optimal immersion, the image would\nbe shot at the same height level that people would view it. It would feel off\nif someone was standing up with a VR headset with the image being taken two\nfeet off the ground.\n\nThus for general shots, take at head level for those standing up, or shoulder\nlevel for those sitting down. The height difference between the two shouldn't\nbe terribly different.\n\n### Sweet Spot\n\nThe Theta has a sweet spot of five feet or less. Farther subjects and the\nbackground will have less resolution, giving a reason to bring subjects closer.\n\n#### Keep it Level\n\nKeep the camera as level as possible with the horizon. If it is not straight,\nwhen people view your photo, they may get sick from not being straight in the\nphoto despite being straight in real life. It would be possible to straigthen\nit afterwards, but you save a lot of work getting it right out of the camera.\n\n#### Fill the Frame\n\nNote that it is 360-degree photography. Since you are capturing the whole\nenvironment, you most likely and should not just have one subject. With only\none subject, when people look around in the picture with the headset, they\nmight have trouble finding the subject as most of the frame will be empty. So\nmake sure the frame has interesting subjects in every direction.\n\nAlongside the advice of shooting close, 360-degree photography seems to lend\nitself better to shooting in tighter scenes. I shot the Theta inside a small\nwooden model of an ancient Chinese building, and the image seemed like it was\ntaken in a full-sized house.\n\n### Limit your Presence\n\nTry to get out of the shot as much as possible. Since it takes an image in\nevery direction, it can be difficult to hide. The best option is to get out of\nthe shot entirely. This means setting the tripod down, and hiding behind a bush\nor corner while remotely triggering the shot. Unfortunately, this is a bit\nawkward in street photography and snapshot situations.\n\nThe second best option is to be directly under the camera. Hold the tripod up,\nresting it on your shoulder or head, and have the camera be above your head.\nThis helps that when people view the photo, they would have to view directly\ndown to see you. And your face would not be visible, only the top of your head,\nwhich is much more discreet.\n\n### Being Discreet\n\nThe Theta is so small, and with 360-degree photography being something most\npeople have no idea about, it is extremely easy to take candid or street shots.\n\nA lot of the time in Hong Kong, I would just walk around holding the tripod\nlike how a Queen's Guard would hold their rifle, and just take photos using the\napp. Using the app really makes it look like you're just checking Facebook or\nsomething, and people never really know you're taking a photo. Or I might just\nset the tripod down, lean against the wall like I'm texting, and take a photo.\n\nWell, it does emit an annoying shutter sound that I don't know how to turn off.\nBut even then, people won't know what that little thing is yet.

The Ricoh Theta S is a freshly released camera featuring two 180-degree\nwide-angle lens that can take 360-degree (equirectangular) photos with a single\nexposure or button press, opening up immersive 360-degree photography to the\nmasses. With most familiar only with flat 2D photography, there is a completely\ndifferent workflow to adapt to. Taking the Theta to the streets of Mong\nKok, the most population-dense area and literally the busiest district in the\nworld, here is what I learned about 360-degree shooting workflow and composition.\n\n---\n\n## About the Ricoh Theta S\n\nThe Ricoh Theta S is the successor to the Ricoh Theta, featuring improvements\nacross the board just crossing the line of producing usable images. Quick rundown of the\ntechnical specs:\n\n- Two 180-degree fisheye lens (f2)\n- 12-megapixel JPEG images (4200x2800)\n- Remote connectivity through Wi-Fi with [Android][android] and [iOS][ios] app\n- Manual exposure capability (though aperture is fixed at f2)\n- Low quality video capability including audio (30fps, upscaled 1920x1080)\n\nIt retails at $350. Given the specs, it is an expensive toy for enthusiasts and\nearly adopters\n\n## Shooting Workflow\n\nHere's what I learned about shooting the camera itself, the physical aspects.\n\n### Remote Shutter is Mandatory\n\nIf you handhold the camera, your hand will be very prominent on the lower half\nof the 360-degree image. The shutter button is situated underneath the lens,\nand there is no way to hide your hand while pressing the button. Unfortunately,\nthe Theta S does not have a built-in timer capability.\n\nSo you must use the Android or iOS apps (linked above) to trigger the shutter\nremotely. Install the app, make sure Wi-Fi is not switched off on the camera,\nconnect to the camera via Wi-Fi (the password is on the bottom of the camera),\nand launch the app. You can get a (choppy) live view of the image from the app\nas well.\n\n### Tripod is Mandatory\n\nWe can shooting remotely, but we need a tripod to hold the camera without\nfilling up the shot. The Theta *can* stand up by itself, but placing it\non a flat surface will cause the surface to take up a lot of the shot. A\ntripod, being a stick, won't take up as much room.\n\nIt also allows complete freedom to compose the shot. And it allows us to hold\nthe camera well above head-level.\n\nI use the [Sony VCT-R100 Tripod][tripod]. It's cheap, lightweight, very\nadjustable, and folds up small enough to fit comfortably into a messenger bag.\nThe pan handle is also useful as a hook to carry the tripod around hands-free.\nIt's useful for holding above head or placing on the ground.\n\nFor a tripod purely for walkaround street photography, I'd also consider\nthe [Pedco Ultrapod II][tripod2], to be very discreet. Although it is less\nversatile than having a tripod that can go to full height.\n\n### Exposure Settings\n\nThe Theta has auto, shutter priority, ISO priority, and manual modes.\nThe aperture is fixed at f2. I switch between shutter speed and ISO priority\ndepending on the situation.\n\nI mainly shoot ISO priority as it leaves less guesswork. During the day, I\nmight use about 200-400 ISO just to make sure I get a good shutter speed.\nDuring the night, if the scene had no moving subjects and the camera was on a\nstable tripod, I might use ISO 100 to get reduce noise.\n\nShooting shutter speed priority has bitten me. During the day, I tried to set\n1/80 maximum shutter speed and everything was blown out. It's hard to guess\nwhat the minimum shutter speed is so using ISO priority at a low setting\nensures getting that minimum shutter speed.\n\n### Review Images Often\n\nThere is less instant feedback when shooting with the Theta since there is no\nLCD on the camera. Images must be transferred over Wi-Fi which can take several seconds.\nAnd using the app, it is often too much of a hassle to go to image viewing mode\nand then back to shooting mode.\n\nBut every once in a while, make sure to chimp on your images to make sure the\nexposure settings are correct. Especially when learning to use the camera, it\nalso helps to check if the composition looks good. It can be surprising with\nthe wide-angle lens how much it stretches perspective.\n\n### Handling\n\nI found some tips on handling the Theta you will want to know about:\n\n- The Theta goes to sleep after a while. The LED above the shutter will\nblink. To wake it up, just press the shutter button.\n- The Wi-Fi server on the camera takes a few seconds to boot up. So try to leave\nit on while you are shooting or carrying it around. This probably affects\nbattery life, so bring along some USB battery packs. The Theta might\nlast only about half a day.\n- Just turn off live view in shooting mode. Turning it off reduces\nshutter lag, probably saves battery life, and the feed is too choppy and grainy\nto be useful anyways.\n- The app will also sometimes become unresponsive so you will have to restart it.\n- Turning on noise reduction immensely improves image quality.\n- Keep the cover on when not in use. It's bound to get scratched or dropped.\n- Don't seriously use the video function. 30FPS at less-than-HD quality is\npretty useless for consumption.\n\n### Shooting Alongside a Regular Camera\n\nIf you're out on a shoot, you will probably still want to pack your regular\ncamera alongside the Theta. It will be difficult to wield your regular camera\nalong with a tripod with the Theta attached.\n\nI *heavily* recommend the [Capture Camera Clip][clip]. The Capture allows you\nto holster the camera on a belt or strap. This allows you to carry a camera\nhands-free when not in use, without any annoying camera straps. It's secure; I\ncarry my Pentax K3 on my hip even in tight subways in China without worrying\nabout getting it swiped.\n\nI also recommend getting a tripod head with a quick-release plate. With the\nTheta on a quick release plate, and the Capture being compatible with\nquick-release plates, you can switch on the tripod between the Theta and\nregular camera rapidly without having to spend time screwing around (pun\nintended). I got a quick-release tripod ball head in Mong Kok for $40!\n\n## Composition\n\nHere's what I learned about shooting 360-degree photography overall, the mental aspects.\n\n### What You See is What You Get\n\nTraditionally with wide-angle lenses, the perspective is dramatically\nstretched. The foreground will appear very close, and the background will\nappear very far. In normal photography, it would be important to get close to\nthe subject else everything would seem very far.\n\nWith 360 photography however since the resulting image will be wrapped around a\nsphere rather than displayed on a 2D plane, the perspective will appear like\nwhat you see with your own eyes in real life. Thus, what you see when you take\na shot with the Theta is what you get.\n\n### Height Level for Immersion\n\nBe mindful about how people will view your image. Mostly likely, they will\neither be standing up, or sitting down. For optimal immersion, the image would\nbe shot at the same height level that people would view it. It would feel off\nif someone was standing up with a VR headset with the image being taken two\nfeet off the ground.\n\nThus for general shots, take at head level for those standing up, or shoulder\nlevel for those sitting down. The height difference between the two shouldn't\nbe terribly different.\n\n### Sweet Spot\n\nThe Theta has a sweet spot of five feet or less. Farther subjects and the\nbackground will have less resolution, giving a reason to bring subjects closer.\n\n#### Keep it Level\n\nKeep the camera as level as possible with the horizon. If it is not straight,\nwhen people view your photo, they may get sick from not being straight in the\nphoto despite being straight in real life. It would be possible to straigthen\nit afterwards, but you save a lot of work getting it right out of the camera.\n\n#### Fill the Frame\n\nNote that it is 360-degree photography. Since you are capturing the whole\nenvironment, you most likely and should not just have one subject. With only\none subject, when people look around in the picture with the headset, they\nmight have trouble finding the subject as most of the frame will be empty. So\nmake sure the frame has interesting subjects in every direction.\n\nAlongside the advice of shooting close, 360-degree photography seems to lend\nitself better to shooting in tighter scenes. I shot the Theta inside a small\nwooden model of an ancient Chinese building, and the image seemed like it was\ntaken in a full-sized house.\n\n### Limit your Presence\n\nTry to get out of the shot as much as possible. Since it takes an image in\nevery direction, it can be difficult to hide. The best option is to get out of\nthe shot entirely. This means setting the tripod down, and hiding behind a bush\nor corner while remotely triggering the shot. Unfortunately, this is a bit\nawkward in street photography and snapshot situations.\n\nThe second best option is to be directly under the camera. Hold the tripod up,\nresting it on your shoulder or head, and have the camera be above your head.\nThis helps that when people view the photo, they would have to view directly\ndown to see you. And your face would not be visible, only the top of your head,\nwhich is much more discreet.\n\n### Being Discreet\n\nThe Theta is so small, and with 360-degree photography being something most\npeople have no idea about, it is extremely easy to take candid or street shots.\n\nA lot of the time in Hong Kong, I would just walk around holding the tripod\nlike how a Queen's Guard would hold their rifle, and just take photos using the\napp. Using the app really makes it look like you're just checking Facebook or\nsomething, and people never really know you're taking a photo. Or I might just\nset the tripod down, lean against the wall like I'm texting, and take a photo.\n\nWell, it does emit an annoying shutter sound that I don't know how to turn off.\nBut even then, people won't know what that little thing is yet. Not until it\nbecomes more popular.\n\n## Sharing Images\n\n> You can now try out my project [threeschwifty](https://ngokevin.github.io/threeschwifty) to view and share your 360-degree images online!\n\nIn an upcoming post, I'll talk more about how to easily share Theta images\nusing A-Frame VR.

Quick rundown of the\ntechnical specs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two 180-degree fisheye lens (f2)</li>\n<li>12-megapixel JPEG images (4200x2800)</li>\n<li>Remote connectivity through Wi-Fi with <a href=\"http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theta360\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Android</a> and <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ricoh-theta-s/id1023254741?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">iOS</a> app</li>\n<li>Manual exposure capability (though aperture is fixed at f2)</li>\n<li>Low quality video capability including audio (30fps, upscaled 1920x1080)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It retails at $350. Given the specs, it is an expensive toy for enthusiasts and\nearly adopters</p>\n<h2 id=\"Shooting-Workflow\"><a href=\"#Shooting-Workflow\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Shooting Workflow\"></a>Shooting Workflow</h2><p>Here’s what I learned about shooting the camera itself, the physical aspects.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Remote-Shutter-is-Mandatory\"><a href=\"#Remote-Shutter-is-Mandatory\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Remote Shutter is Mandatory\"></a>Remote Shutter is Mandatory</h3><p>If you handhold the camera, your hand will be very prominent on the lower half\nof the 360-degree image. The shutter button is situated underneath the lens,\nand there is no way to hide your hand while pressing the button. Unfortunately,\nthe Theta S does not have a built-in timer capability.</p>\n<p>So you must use the Android or iOS apps (linked above) to trigger the shutter\nremotely. Install the app, make sure Wi-Fi is not switched off on the camera,\nconnect to the camera via Wi-Fi (the password is on the bottom of the camera),\nand launch the app. You can get a (choppy) live view of the image from the app\nas well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Tripod-is-Mandatory\"><a href=\"#Tripod-is-Mandatory\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Tripod is Mandatory\"></a>Tripod is Mandatory</h3><p>We can shooting remotely, but we need a tripod to hold the camera without\nfilling up the shot. The Theta <em>can</em> stand up by itself, but placing it\non a flat surface will cause the surface to take up a lot of the shot. A\ntripod, being a stick, won’t take up as much room.</p>\n<p>It also allows complete freedom to compose the shot. And it allows us to hold\nthe camera well above head-level.</p>\n<p>I use the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sony-VCT-R100-Lightweight-Compact-Tripod/dp/B000EFIJTA/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Sony VCT-R100 Tripod</a>. It’s cheap, lightweight, very\nadjustable, and folds up small enough to fit comfortably into a messenger bag.\nThe pan handle is also useful as a hook to carry the tripod around hands-free.\nIt’s useful for holding above head or placing on the ground.</p>\n<p>For a tripod purely for walkaround street photography, I’d also consider\nthe <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Pedco-UltraPod-Lightweight-Camera-Tripod/dp/B000ANCPNM/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Pedco Ultrapod II</a>, to be very discreet. Although it is less\nversatile than having a tripod that can go to full height.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Exposure-Settings\"><a href=\"#Exposure-Settings\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Exposure Settings\"></a>Exposure Settings</h3><p>The Theta has auto, shutter priority, ISO priority, and manual modes.\nThe aperture is fixed at f2. I switch between shutter speed and ISO priority\ndepending on the situation.</p>\n<p>I mainly shoot ISO priority as it leaves less guesswork. During the day, I\nmight use about 200-400 ISO just to make sure I get a good shutter speed.\nDuring the night, if the scene had no moving subjects and the camera was on a\nstable tripod, I might use ISO 100 to get reduce noise.</p>\n<p>Shooting shutter speed priority has bitten me. During the day, I tried to set\n1/80 maximum shutter speed and everything was blown out. It’s hard to guess\nwhat the minimum shutter speed is so using ISO priority at a low setting\nensures getting that minimum shutter speed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Review-Images-Often\"><a href=\"#Review-Images-Often\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Review Images Often\"></a>Review Images Often</h3><p>There is less instant feedback when shooting with the Theta since there is no\nLCD on the camera. Images must be transferred over Wi-Fi which can take several seconds.\nAnd using the app, it is often too much of a hassle to go to image viewing mode\nand then back to shooting mode.</p>\n<p>But every once in a while, make sure to chimp on your images to make sure the\nexposure settings are correct. Especially when learning to use the camera, it\nalso helps to check if the composition looks good. It can be surprising with\nthe wide-angle lens how much it stretches perspective.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Handling\"><a href=\"#Handling\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Handling\"></a>Handling</h3><p>I found some tips on handling the Theta you will want to know about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Theta goes to sleep after a while. The LED above the shutter will\nblink. To wake it up, just press the shutter button.</li>\n<li>The Wi-Fi server on the camera takes a few seconds to boot up. So try to leave\nit on while you are shooting or carrying it around. This probably affects\nbattery life, so bring along some USB battery packs. The Theta might\nlast only about half a day.</li>\n<li>Just turn off live view in shooting mode. Turning it off reduces\nshutter lag, probably saves battery life, and the feed is too choppy and grainy\nto be useful anyways.</li>\n<li>The app will also sometimes become unresponsive so you will have to restart it.</li>\n<li>Turning on noise reduction immensely improves image quality.</li>\n<li>Keep the cover on when not in use. It’s bound to get scratched or dropped.</li>\n<li>Don’t seriously use the video function. 30FPS at less-than-HD quality is\npretty useless for consumption.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Shooting-Alongside-a-Regular-Camera\"><a href=\"#Shooting-Alongside-a-Regular-Camera\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Shooting Alongside a Regular Camera\"></a>Shooting Alongside a Regular Camera</h3><p>If you’re out on a shoot, you will probably still want to pack your regular\ncamera alongside the Theta. It will be difficult to wield your regular camera\nalong with a tripod with the Theta attached.</p>\n<p>I <em>heavily</em> recommend the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Peak-Design-Capture-Camera-Clip/dp/B00H7JGOS4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1451841715&amp;sr=8-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Capture Camera Clip</a>. The Capture allows you\nto holster the camera on a belt or strap. This allows you to carry a camera\nhands-free when not in use, without any annoying camera straps. It’s secure; I\ncarry my Pentax K3 on my hip even in tight subways in China without worrying\nabout getting it swiped.</p>\n<p>I also recommend getting a tripod head with a quick-release plate. With the\nTheta on a quick release plate, and the Capture being compatible with\nquick-release plates, you can switch on the tripod between the Theta and\nregular camera rapidly without having to spend time screwing around (pun\nintended). I got a quick-release tripod ball head in Mong Kok for $40!</p>\n<h2 id=\"Composition\"><a href=\"#Composition\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Composition\"></a>Composition</h2><p>Here’s what I learned about shooting 360-degree photography overall, the mental aspects.</p>\n<h3 id=\"What-You-See-is-What-You-Get\"><a href=\"#What-You-See-is-What-You-Get\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What You See is What You Get\"></a>What You See is What You Get</h3><p>Traditionally with wide-angle lenses, the perspective is dramatically\nstretched. The foreground will appear very close, and the background will\nappear very far. In normal photography, it would be important to get close to\nthe subject else everything would seem very far.</p>\n<p>With 360 photography however since the resulting image will be wrapped around a\nsphere rather than displayed on a 2D plane, the perspective will appear like\nwhat you see with your own eyes in real life. Thus, what you see when you take\na shot with the Theta is what you get.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Height-Level-for-Immersion\"><a href=\"#Height-Level-for-Immersion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Height Level for Immersion\"></a>Height Level for Immersion</h3><p>Be mindful about how people will view your image. Mostly likely, they will\neither be standing up, or sitting down. For optimal immersion, the image would\nbe shot at the same height level that people would view it. It would feel off\nif someone was standing up with a VR headset with the image being taken two\nfeet off the ground.</p>\n<p>Thus for general shots, take at head level for those standing up, or shoulder\nlevel for those sitting down. The height difference between the two shouldn’t\nbe terribly different.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Sweet-Spot\"><a href=\"#Sweet-Spot\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Sweet Spot\"></a>Sweet Spot</h3><p>The Theta has a sweet spot of five feet or less. Farther subjects and the\nbackground will have less resolution, giving a reason to bring subjects closer.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Keep-it-Level\"><a href=\"#Keep-it-Level\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Keep it Level\"></a>Keep it Level</h4><p>Keep the camera as level as possible with the horizon. If it is not straight,\nwhen people view your photo, they may get sick from not being straight in the\nphoto despite being straight in real life. It would be possible to straigthen\nit afterwards, but you save a lot of work getting it right out of the camera.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Fill-the-Frame\"><a href=\"#Fill-the-Frame\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Fill the Frame\"></a>Fill the Frame</h4><p>Note that it is 360-degree photography. Since you are capturing the whole\nenvironment, you most likely and should not just have one subject. With only\none subject, when people look around in the picture with the headset, they\nmight have trouble finding the subject as most of the frame will be empty. So\nmake sure the frame has interesting subjects in every direction.</p>\n<p>Alongside the advice of shooting close, 360-degree photography seems to lend\nitself better to shooting in tighter scenes. I shot the Theta inside a small\nwooden model of an ancient Chinese building, and the image seemed like it was\ntaken in a full-sized house.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Limit-your-Presence\"><a href=\"#Limit-your-Presence\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Limit your Presence\"></a>Limit your Presence</h3><p>Try to get out of the shot as much as possible. Since it takes an image in\nevery direction, it can be difficult to hide. The best option is to get out of\nthe shot entirely. This means setting the tripod down, and hiding behind a bush\nor corner while remotely triggering the shot. Unfortunately, this is a bit\nawkward in street photography and snapshot situations.</p>\n<p>The second best option is to be directly under the camera. Hold the tripod up,\nresting it on your shoulder or head, and have the camera be above your head.\nThis helps that when people view the photo, they would have to view directly\ndown to see you. And your face would not be visible, only the top of your head,\nwhich is much more discreet.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Being-Discreet\"><a href=\"#Being-Discreet\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Being Discreet\"></a>Being Discreet</h3><p>The Theta is so small, and with 360-degree photography being something most\npeople have no idea about, it is extremely easy to take candid or street shots.</p>\n<p>A lot of the time in Hong Kong, I would just walk around holding the tripod\nlike how a Queen’s Guard would hold their rifle, and just take photos using the\napp. Using the app really makes it look like you’re just checking Facebook or\nsomething, and people never really know you’re taking a photo. Or I might just\nset the tripod down, lean against the wall like I’m texting, and take a photo.</p>\n<p>Well, it does emit an annoying shutter sound that I don’t know how to turn off.\nBut even then, people won’t know what that little thing is yet. Not until it\nbecomes more popular.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Sharing-Images\"><a href=\"#Sharing-Images\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Sharing Images\"></a>Sharing Images</h2><blockquote>\n<p>You can now try out my project <a href=\"https://ngokevin.github.io/threeschwifty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">threeschwifty</a> to view and share your 360-degree images online!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In an upcoming post, I’ll talk more about how to easily share Theta images\nusing A-Frame VR. It’d be a few lines of HTML, and then most people can view\nthe 360 image on their smartphone. They’d be able to move and rotate the phone\nto look around the image, and even use something like a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/get/cardboard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Google\nCardboard</a> holder.</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;script src=&quot;https://aframe.io/releases/latest/aframe.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;a-scene&gt;\n      &lt;a-sky src=&quot;360-image.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-sky&gt;\n    &lt;/a-scene&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre><p><a href=\"http://ngokevin.com/~ngoke/360.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Try it with one of my sample shots</a> in a\nsmall Japanese toy store in Mong Kok.</p>\n"},{"title":"A Glimpse into Competitive VR Gaming","type":"blog","date":"2016-04-04T07:00:00.000Z","id":"competitive-vr-gaming","image":{"url":"http://i.imgur.com/VhhztHL.jpg","caption":"Ready Player One"},"_content":"\n[cs]: http://blog.counter-strike.net/\n[ggo]: http://swordartonline.wikia.com/wiki/Gun_Gale_Online\n[htc]: https://www.htcvive.com/us/\n[mozvr]: http://mozvr.com/\n[spt]: http://www.i-illusions.com/home/space-pirate-trainer/\n\nJust one more quarter.

But in this\nage, the leaderboard is global, the game is in virtual reality, and it’s going\nto take a bit more skill.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.i-illusions.com/home/space-pirate-trainer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">Space Pirate Trainer</a> is a game by I-llusions for the <a href=\"https://www.htcvive.com/us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">HTC Vive</a>\nfeaturing full room-scale and hand-tracked controllers.

Though I’m not alone. It\nrecently updated to include a global leaderboard. At the top is Colin Northway,\ncreator of Fantastic Contraption, with an insane score of 85K. He’s damn\naccurate.  For comparison, my current personal record is 20K, and it takes\nabout 25K to get onto the top ten (at time of writing).

The\nentity-component system treats every **entity** in the scene as a placeholder\nobject which we apply and mix **components** to in order to add appearance,\nbehavior, and functionality. A-Frame comes with some standard components out of\nthe box like camera, geometry, material, light, or sound. However, people can\nwrite, publish, and register their own components to do **whatever** they want\nlike have entities [collide/explode/spawn][collide], be controlled by\n[physics][physics], or [follow a path][follow]. Today, we'll be going through\nhow we can write our own A-Frame components.\n\n---\n\n> **Note**: This article is now part of the A-Frame documentation.

This\ndata is used to modify the entity. For example, we might have an *engine*\ncomponent. Possible properties might be *horsepower* or *cylinders*.\n\n![](http://thevrjump.com/assets/img/articles/aframe-system/aframe-system.jpg)\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nAbstract representation of a component by @rubenmueller of thevrjump.com.\n</span></div>\n\n### From the DOM\n\nLet's first see what a component looks like from the DOM.\n\nFor example, the [light component][light] has properties such as type, color,\nand intensity. In A-Frame, we register and configure a component to an entity\nusing an HTML attribute and a style-like syntax:\n\n    ::html\n    <a-entity light=\"type: point; color: crimson; intensity: 2.5\"></a-entity>\n\nThis would give us a light in the scene. To demonstrate composability, we could\ngive the light a spherical representation by mixing in the [geometry\ncomponent][geometry].\n\n    ::html\n    <a-entity geometry=\"primitive: sphere; radius: 5\"\n              light=\"type: point; color: crimson; intensity: 2.5\"></a-entity>\n\nOr we can configure the position component to move the light sphere a bit to the right.\n\n    ::html\n    <a-entity geometry=\"primitive: sphere; radius: 5\"\n              light=\"type: point; color: crimson; intensity: 2.5\"\n              position=\"5 0 0\"></a-entity>\n\nGiven the style-like syntax and that it modifies the appearance and behavior of\nDOM nodes, component properties can be thought of as a rough analog to CSS. In\nthe near future, I can imagine component property stylesheets.\n\n### Under the Hood\n\nNow let's see what a component looks like **under the hood**. A-Frame's most\nbasic component is the [position component][position]:\n\n    ::js\n    AFRAME.registerComponent('position', {\n      schema: { type: 'vec3' },\n\n      update: function () {\n        var object3D = this.el.object3D;\n        var data = this.data;\n        object3D.position.set(data.x, data.y, data.z);\n      }\n    });\n\nThe position component uses only a tiny subset of the component API, but what\nthis does is register the component with the name \"position\", define a `schema`\nwhere the component's value with be parsed to an `{x, y, z}` object, and when\nthe component initializes or the component's data updates, set the position of\nthe entity with the `update` callback. `this.el` is a reference from the\ncomponent to the DOM element, or entity, and `object3D` is the entity's\n[three.js][three]. Note that A-Frame is built on top of three.js so many\ncomponents will be using the three.js API.\n\nSo we see that components consist of a name and a definition, and then they can\nbe registered to A-Frame. We saw the the position component definition defined\na `schema` and an `update` handler. Components simply consist of the `schema`,\nwhich defines the shape of the data, and several handlers for the component to\nmodify the entity in reaction to different types of events.\n\nHere is the current list of properties and methods of a component definition:\n\n| Property | Description |\n| -------- | ----------- |\n| data     | Data of the component derived from the schema default values, mixins, and the entity's attributes. |\n| el       | Reference to the [entity](https://aframe.io/docs/core/entity.html) element. |\n| schema   | Names, types, and default values of the component property value(s). |\n\n| Method | Description |\n| ------ | ----------- |\n| init   | Called once when the component is initialized. |\n| update | Called both when the component is initialized and whenever the component's data changes (e.g, via *setAttribute*). |\n| remove | Called when the component detaches from the element (e.g., via *removeAttribute*). |\n| tick   | Called on each render loop or tick of the scene. |\n| play   | Called whenever the scene or entity plays to add any background or dynamic behavior. |\n| pause  | Called whenever the scene or entity pauses to remove any background or dynamic behavior. |\n\n## Defining the Schema\n\nThe component's schema defines what type of data it takes. A component can\neither be single-property or consist of multiple properties. And properties\nhave *property types*. Note that single-property schemas and property types are\nbeing released in A-Frame `v0.2.0`.\n\nA property might look like:\n\n    ::js\n    { type: 'int', default: 5 }\n\nAnd a schema consisting of multiple properties might look like:\n\n    ::js\n    {\n      color: { default: '#FFF' },\n      target: { type: 'selector' },\n      uv: {\n        default: '1 1',\n        parse: function (value) {\n          return value.split(' ').map(parseFloat);\n        }\n      },\n    }\n\nSince components in the entity-component system are just buckets of data that\nare used to affect the appearance or behavior of the entity, the schema plays a\ncrucial role in the definition of the component.\n\n### Property Types\n\nA-Frame comes with several built-in property types such as `boolean`, `int`,\n`number`, `selector`, `string`, or `vec3`. Every single property is assigned a\ntype, whether explicitly through the `type` key or implictly via inferring the\nvalue. And each type is used to assign `parse` and `stringify` functions. The\nparser deserializes the incoming string value from the DOM to be put into the\ncomponent's data object. The stringifier is used when using `setAttribute` to\nserialize back to the DOM.\n\nWe can actually define and register our own property types:\n\n    ::js\n    AFRAME.registerPropertyType('radians', {\n      parse: function () {\n\n      }\n\n      // Default stringify is .toString().\n    });\n\n### Single-Property Schemas\n\nIf a component has only one property, then it must either have a `type` or a\n`default` value. If the type is defined, then the type is used to parse and\ncoerce the string retrieved from the DOM (e.g., `getAttribute`). Or if the\ndefault value is defined, the default value is used to infer the type.\n\nTake for instance the [visible component][visible]. The schema property\ndefinition implicitly defines it as a boolean:\n\n    ::js\n    AFRAME.registerComponent('visible', {\n      schema: {\n        // Type will be inferred to be boolean.\n        default: true\n      },\n\n      // ...\n    });\n\nOr the [rotation component][rotation] which explicitly defines the value as a `vec3`:\n\n    ::js\n    AFRAME.registerComponent('rotation', {\n      schema: {\n        // Default value will be 0, 0, 0 as defined by the vec3 property type.\n        type: 'vec3'\n      }\n\n      // ...\n    });\n\nUsing these defined property types, schemas are processed by\n`registerComponent` to inject default values, parsers, and stringifiers for\neach property. So if a default value is not defined, the default value will be\nwhatever the property type defines as the \"default default value\".\n\n### Multiple-Property Schemas\n\nIf a component has multiple properties (or one named property), then it consists of\none or more property definitions, in the form described above, in an object keyed by\nproperty name. For instance, a physics body component might define a schema:\n\n    ::js\n    AFRAME.registerComponent('physics-body', {\n      schema: {\n        boundingBox: {\n          type: 'vec3',\n          default: { x: 1, y: 1, z: 1 }\n        },\n        mass: {\n          default: 0\n        },\n        velocity: {\n          type: 'vec3'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nHaving multiple properties is what makes the component take the syntax in the\nform of `physics=\"mass: 2; velocity: 1 1 1\"`.\n\nWith the schema defined, all data coming into the component will be passed\nthrough the schema for parsing. Then in the lifecycle methods, the component\nhas access to `this.data` which in a single-property schema is a value and in a\nmultiple-propery schema is an object.\n\n## Defining the Lifecycle Methods\n\n### Component.init() - Set Up\n\n`init` is called once in the component's lifecycle when it is mounted to the\nentity. `init` is generally used to set up variables or members that may used\nthroughout the component or to set up state. Though not every component will\nneed to define an `init` handler. Sort of like the component-equivalent method\nto `createdCallback` or `React.ComponentDidMount`.\n\nFor example, the `look-at` component's `init` handler sets up some variables:\n\n    ::js\n    init: function () {\n      this.target3D = null;\n      this.vector = new THREE.Vector3();\n    },\n\n    // ...\n\nExample uses of `init` by some of the standard A-Frame components:\n\n| Component     | Usage |\n| ---------     | ----- |\n| camera        | Create and set a THREE.PerspectiveCamera on the entity. |\n| cursor        | Attach event listeners. |\n| light         | Register light to the lighting system. |\n| look-at       | Create a helper vector. |\n| material      | Set up variables, mainly to visualize the state of the component. |\n| wasd-controls | Set up an object to keep track of pressed keys. Bind methods. |\n\n### Component.update(oldData) - Do the Magic\n\nThe `update` handler is called both at the beginning of the component's\nlifecycle with the initial `this.data` *and* every time the component's data\nchanges (generally during the entity's `attributeChangedCallback` like with a\n`setAttribute`). The update handler gets access to the previous state of the\ncomponent data passed in through `oldData`. The previous state of the component\ncan be used to tell exactly which properties changed to do more granular\nupdates.\n\nThe update handler uses `this.data` to modify the entity, usually interacting\nwith three.js APIs. One of the simplest update handlers is the\n[visible][visible] component's:\n\n    ::js\n    update: function () {\n      this.el.object3D.visible = this.data;\n    }\n\nA slightly more complex update handler might be the [light][light] component's,\nwhich we'll show via abbreviated code:\n\n    ::js\n    update: function (oldData) {\n      var diffData = diff(data, oldData || {});\n\n      if (this.light && !('type' in diffData)) {\n        // If there is an existing light and the type hasn't changed, update light.\n        Object.keys(diffData).forEach(function (property) {\n          light[property] = diffData[property];\n        });\n      } else {\n        // No light exists yet or the type of light has changed, create a new light.\n        this.light = this.getLight(this.data));\n\n        // Register the object3D of type `light` to the entity.\n        this.el.setObject3D('light', this.light);\n      }\n    }\n\nThe entity's `object3D` is a plain THREE.Object3D. Other three.js object types\nsuch as meshes, lights, and cameras can be set with `setObject3D` where they\nwill be appeneded to the entity's `object3D`.\n\nExample uses of `update` by some of the standard A-Frame components:\n\n| Component     | Usage |\n| ---------     | ----- |\n| camera        | Set THREE.PerspectiveCamera object properties such as aspect ratio, fov, or near/far clipping planes. |\n| look-at       | Set or update target entity to track the position of.\n| material      | If component is just attaching, create a material. If shader has not changed, update material. If shader has changed, replace the material.\n| wasd-controls | Update the position based on the current velocity. Update the velocity based on the keys pressed.\n\n### Component.remove() - Tear Down\n\nThe `remove` handler is called when the component detaches from the entity such\nas with `removeAttribute`. This is generally used to remove all modifications,\nlisteners, and behaviors to the entity that the component added.\n\nFor example, when the [light component][light] detaches, it removes the light\nit previously attached from the entity and thus the scene:\n\n    ::js\n    remove: function () {\n      this.el.removeObject3D('light');\n    }\n\nExample uses of `remove` by some of the standard A-Frame components:\n\n| Component     | Usage |\n| ---------     | ----- |\n| camera        | Remove the THREE.PerspectiveCamera from the entity. |\n| geometry      | Set a plain THREE.Geometry on the mesh. |\n| material      | Set a default THREE.MeshBasicMaterial on the mesh and unregister material from the system. |\n| wasd-controls | Remove keydown and keyup listeners. |\n\n### Component.tick(time) - Background Behavior\n\nThe `tick` handler is called on every single tick or render loop of the scene.\nSo expect it to run on the order of 60-120 times for second. The global uptime of\nthe scene in seconds is passed into the tick handler.\n\nFor example, the [look-at][look-at] component, which instructs an entity to\nlook at another target entity, uses the tick handler to update the rotation in\ncase the target entity changes its position:\n\n    ::js\n    tick: function (t) {\n      // target3D and vector are set from the update handler.\n      if (this.target3D) {\n        this.el.object3D.lookAt(this.vector.setFromMatrixPosition(target3D.matrixWorld));\n      }\n    }\n\nExample uses of `tick` by some of the standard A-Frame components:\n\n| Component     | Usage |\n| ---------     | ----- |\n| look-at       | Update rotation of entity to face towards tracked target, in case the target is moving.\n| physics       | Update the physics world simulation.\n| wasd-controls | Use current velocity to move the entity (generally the camera), update velocity if keys are pressed.\n\n### Component.pause() and Component.play() - Stop and Go\n\nTo support pause and play, just as with a video game or to toggle entities for\nperformance, components can implement `play` and `pause` handlers. These are\ninvoked when the component's entity runs its `play` or `pause` method. When an\nentity plays or pauses, all of its child entities are also played or paused.\n\nComponents should implement play or pause handlers if they register any\ndynamic, asynchronous, or background behavior such as animations, event\nlisteners, or tick handlers.\n\nFor example, the `look-controls` component simply removes its event listeners\nsuch that the camera does not move when the scene is paused, and it adds its\nevent listeners when the scene starts playing or is resumed:\n\n    ::js\n    pause: function () {\n      this.removeEventListeners()\n    },\n\n    play: function () {\n      this.addEventListeners()\n    }\n\nExample uses of `pause` and `play` by some of the standard A-Frame components:\n\n| Component     | Usage |\n| ---------     | ----- |\n| sound         | Pause/play sound.\n| wasd-controls | Remove/attach event listeners.\n\n## Boilerplate\n\nI suggest that people start off with my [component boilerplate][boilerplate],\neven hardcore tool junkies. This will get you straight into building a\ncomponent and comes with everything you will need to publish your component\ninto the wild. The boilerplate handles creating a stubbed component, build\nsteps for both NPM and browser distribution files, and publishing to Github\nPages.\n\nGenerally with boilerplates, it is better to start from scratch and build your\nown boilerplate, but the A-Frame component boilerplate contains a lot of tribal\ninside knowledge about A-Frame and is updated frequently to reflect new things\nlanding on A-Frame. The only possibly opinionated pieces about the boilerplate\nis the development tools it internally uses that are hidden away by NPM\nscripts.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Line Component\n\nLet's go through building a basic complete component, a *line* component. This\nline component will simply render a line. We will make it the component\nflexible to be able to specify the vertices and color.\n\n> Play with this [example line component in Codepen](https://codepen.io/team/mozvr/pen/yeEQNG).\n\n#### Line Component - Skeleton\n\nHere is a high-level view of the skeleton of the component, without the meat.\nFor this component, we'll need the `schema`, as all components require, the\n`update` handler, and the `remove` handler. The rest of the lifecycle method\nhandlers aren't necessary.\n\n    ::js\n    var coordinates = AFRAME.utils.coordinates;\n\n    AFRAME.registerComponent('line', {\n      // Allow line component to accept vertices and color.\n      schema: {},\n\n      // Create or update the line geometry.\n      update: {},\n\n      // Remove the line geometry.\n      remove: {}\n    });\n\n#### Line Component -Schema\n\nSince we have two properties we want to accept, `color` and `path`, we will\nneed a multi-property schema. The `color` property will just be a simple string\nthat will be fed to `THREE.Color` which does a lot of work for us. The `path`\nproperty will need a custom property type to parse an array of `vec3`s. That\nproperty type does not exist as a built-in type yet, but we can define an\ninline parse and stringifier.\n\n    ::js\n      // Allow line component to accept vertices and color.\n      schema: {\n        color: { default: '#333' },\n\n        path: {\n          default: [\n            { x: -0.5, y: 0, z: 0 },\n            { x: 0.5, y: 0, z: 0 }\n          ],\n\n          // Deserialize path in the form of comma-separated vec3s: `0 0 0, 1 1 1, 2 0 3`.\n          parse: function (value) {\n            return value.split(',').map(coordinates.parse);\n          },\n\n          // Serialize array of vec3s in case someone does\n          // setAttribute('line', 'path', [...]).\n          stringify: function (data) {\n            return data.map(coordinates.stringify).join(',');\n          }\n        }\n      },\n\n      //...\n\nThe component API is entirely up to us. If we wanted the path to take a\ndifferent syntax or abstract it further such that it maybe only accepts a\nstarting point and a length and handle the math for the developer, that is our\nperogative to permissionlessly implement.\n\nThe schema will handle the shape of the data so by the time it gets to the\nlifecycle handlers, it will be in a nice data structure.\n\n#### Line Component - Update\n\nThe `update` handler is called both on component attach and on the entity's\n`attributeChangedCallback`. In the update for the line component, we want to\nreate a line geometry if it doesn't exist yet, or update it if it does. We can\ncreate a line in `three.js` by combining a `THREE.LineBasicMaterial` and\n`THREE.Geometry` and manually pushing vertices.\n\n    ::js\n    update: function (oldData) {\n      // Set color with material.\n      var material = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({\n        color: this.data.color\n      });\n\n      // Add vertices to geometry.\n      var geometry = new THREE.Geometry();\n      this.data.path.forEach(function (vec3) {\n        geometry.vertices.push(\n          new THREE.Vector3(vec3.x, vec3.y, vec3.z)\n        );\n      });\n\n      // Apply mesh.\n      this.el.setObject3D('mesh', new THREE.Line(geometry, material));\n    },\n\n    // ...\n\nFor simplicity, we can just update the line by completely replacing it. In\nother components, we might want to more granularly update objects for\nperformance.\n\nWhen we set the object with `setObject3D`, we specify the object type. In this\ncase, it is a `mesh`, which is a geometry combined with a material. Other\nobject types might be `light` or `camera`. `setObject3D` just puts the object\ninto a map and appends the object under the entity's scene graph\n(`THREE.Group`).\n\n#### Line Component - Remove\n\nFor removal, we can just use `removeObject3D`:\n\n    ::js\n    remove: function () {\n      this.el.removeObject3D('mesh');\n    }\n\nThis will remove the object from the entity's scene graph.\n\n#### Line Component - Usage\n\nThen we with the line component written and registered, we can use it in HTML:\n\n    ::html\n    <a-scene>\n      <a-assets>\n        <a-mixin id=\"red\" line=\"color: #E20049\"></a-mixin>\n      </a-assets>\n\n      <a-entity id=\"happy-face\" position=\"0 2 -10\">\n        <a-entity mixin=\"red\" line=\"path: -1 1 0, -1 0.5 0, -1 0 0\"></a-entity>\n        <a-entity mixin=\"red\" line=\"path: 1 1 0, 1 0.5 0, 1 0 0\"></a-entity>\n        <a-entity mixin=\"red\" line=\"path: -2 -1 0, 0 -2 0, 2 -1\"></a-entity>\n      </a-entity>\n\n      <a-sky color=\"#FFEED0\"></a-sky>\n    </a-scene>\n\nAnd voila!\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/icggby2.jpg)\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\n  Happy face with the line component!

The\nentity-component system treats every **entity** in the scene as a placeholder\nobject which we apply and mix **components** to in order to add appearance,\nbehavior, and functionality. A-Frame comes with some standard components out of\nthe box like camera, geometry, material, light, or sound. However, people can\nwrite, publish, and register their own components to do **whatever** they want\nlike have entities [collide/explode/spawn][collide], be controlled by\n[physics][physics], or [follow a path][follow]. Today, we'll be going through\nhow we can write our own A-Frame components.\n\n---\n\n> **Note**: This article is now part of the A-Frame documentation.

This\ndata is used to modify the entity. For example, we might have an *engine*\ncomponent. Possible properties might be *horsepower* or *cylinders*.\n\n![](http://thevrjump.com/assets/img/articles/aframe-system/aframe-system.jpg)\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\nAbstract representation of a component by @rubenmueller of thevrjump.com.\n</span></div>\n\n### From the DOM\n\nLet's first see what a component looks like from the DOM.\n\nFor example, the [light component][light] has properties such as type, color,\nand intensity. In A-Frame, we register and configure a component to an entity\nusing an HTML attribute and a style-like syntax:\n\n    ::html\n    <a-entity light=\"type: point; color: crimson; intensity: 2.5\"></a-entity>\n\nThis would give us a light in the scene. To demonstrate composability, we could\ngive the light a spherical representation by mixing in the [geometry\ncomponent][geometry].\n\n    ::html\n    <a-entity geometry=\"primitive: sphere; radius: 5\"\n              light=\"type: point; color: crimson; intensity: 2.5\"></a-entity>\n\nOr we can configure the position component to move the light sphere a bit to the right.\n\n    ::html\n    <a-entity geometry=\"primitive: sphere; radius: 5\"\n              light=\"type: point; color: crimson; intensity: 2.5\"\n              position=\"5 0 0\"></a-entity>\n\nGiven the style-like syntax and that it modifies the appearance and behavior of\nDOM nodes, component properties can be thought of as a rough analog to CSS. In\nthe near future, I can imagine component property stylesheets.\n\n### Under the Hood\n\nNow let's see what a component looks like **under the hood**. A-Frame's most\nbasic component is the [position component][position]:\n\n    ::js\n    AFRAME.registerComponent('position', {\n      schema: { type: 'vec3' },\n\n      update: function () {\n        var object3D = this.el.object3D;\n        var data = this.data;\n        object3D.position.set(data.x, data.y, data.z);\n      }\n    });\n\nThe position component uses only a tiny subset of the component API, but what\nthis does is register the component with the name \"position\", define a `schema`\nwhere the component's value with be parsed to an `{x, y, z}` object, and when\nthe component initializes or the component's data updates, set the position of\nthe entity with the `update` callback. `this.el` is a reference from the\ncomponent to the DOM element, or entity, and `object3D` is the entity's\n[three.js][three]. Note that A-Frame is built on top of three.js so many\ncomponents will be using the three.js API.\n\nSo we see that components consist of a name and a definition, and then they can\nbe registered to A-Frame. We saw the the position component definition defined\na `schema` and an `update` handler. Components simply consist of the `schema`,\nwhich defines the shape of the data, and several handlers for the component to\nmodify the entity in reaction to different types of events.\n\nHere is the current list of properties and methods of a component definition:\n\n| Property | Description |\n| -------- | ----------- |\n| data     | Data of the component derived from the schema default values, mixins, and the entity's attributes. |\n| el       | Reference to the [entity](https://aframe.io/docs/core/entity.html) element. |\n| schema   | Names, types, and default values of the component property value(s). |\n\n| Method | Description |\n| ------ | ----------- |\n| init   | Called once when the component is initialized. |\n| update | Called both when the component is initialized and whenever the component's data changes (e.g, via *setAttribute*). |\n| remove | Called when the component detaches from the element (e.g., via *removeAttribute*). |\n| tick   | Called on each render loop or tick of the scene. |\n| play   | Called whenever the scene or entity plays to add any background or dynamic behavior. |\n| pause  | Called whenever the scene or entity pauses to remove any background or dynamic behavior. |\n\n## Defining the Schema\n\nThe component's schema defines what type of data it takes. A component can\neither be single-property or consist of multiple properties. And properties\nhave *property types*. Note that single-property schemas and property types are\nbeing released in A-Frame `v0.2.0`.\n\nA property might look like:\n\n    ::js\n    { type: 'int', default: 5 }\n\nAnd a schema consisting of multiple properties might look like:\n\n    ::js\n    {\n      color: { default: '#FFF' },\n      target: { type: 'selector' },\n      uv: {\n        default: '1 1',\n        parse: function (value) {\n          return value.split(' ').map(parseFloat);\n        }\n      },\n    }\n\nSince components in the entity-component system are just buckets of data that\nare used to affect the appearance or behavior of the entity, the schema plays a\ncrucial role in the definition of the component.\n\n### Property Types\n\nA-Frame comes with several built-in property types such as `boolean`, `int`,\n`number`, `selector`, `string`, or `vec3`. Every single property is assigned a\ntype, whether explicitly through the `type` key or implictly via inferring the\nvalue. And each type is used to assign `parse` and `stringify` functions. The\nparser deserializes the incoming string value from the DOM to be put into the\ncomponent's data object. The stringifier is used when using `setAttribute` to\nserialize back to the DOM.\n\nWe can actually define and register our own property types:\n\n    ::js\n    AFRAME.registerPropertyType('radians', {\n      parse: function () {\n\n      }\n\n      // Default stringify is .toString().\n    });\n\n### Single-Property Schemas\n\nIf a component has only one property, then it must either have a `type` or a\n`default` value. If the type is defined, then the type is used to parse and\ncoerce the string retrieved from the DOM (e.g., `getAttribute`). Or if the\ndefault value is defined, the default value is used to infer the type.\n\nTake for instance the [visible component][visible]. The schema property\ndefinition implicitly defines it as a boolean:\n\n    ::js\n    AFRAME.registerComponent('visible', {\n      schema: {\n        // Type will be inferred to be boolean.\n        default: true\n      },\n\n      // ...\n    });\n\nOr the [rotation component][rotation] which explicitly defines the value as a `vec3`:\n\n    ::js\n    AFRAME.registerComponent('rotation', {\n      schema: {\n        // Default value will be 0, 0, 0 as defined by the vec3 property type.\n        type: 'vec3'\n      }\n\n      // ...\n    });\n\nUsing these defined property types, schemas are processed by\n`registerComponent` to inject default values, parsers, and stringifiers for\neach property. So if a default value is not defined, the default value will be\nwhatever the property type defines as the \"default default value\".\n\n### Multiple-Property Schemas\n\nIf a component has multiple properties (or one named property), then it consists of\none or more property definitions, in the form described above, in an object keyed by\nproperty name. For instance, a physics body component might define a schema:\n\n    ::js\n    AFRAME.registerComponent('physics-body', {\n      schema: {\n        boundingBox: {\n          type: 'vec3',\n          default: { x: 1, y: 1, z: 1 }\n        },\n        mass: {\n          default: 0\n        },\n        velocity: {\n          type: 'vec3'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nHaving multiple properties is what makes the component take the syntax in the\nform of `physics=\"mass: 2; velocity: 1 1 1\"`.\n\nWith the schema defined, all data coming into the component will be passed\nthrough the schema for parsing. Then in the lifecycle methods, the component\nhas access to `this.data` which in a single-property schema is a value and in a\nmultiple-propery schema is an object.\n\n## Defining the Lifecycle Methods\n\n### Component.init() - Set Up\n\n`init` is called once in the component's lifecycle when it is mounted to the\nentity. `init` is generally used to set up variables or members that may used\nthroughout the component or to set up state. Though not every component will\nneed to define an `init` handler. Sort of like the component-equivalent method\nto `createdCallback` or `React.ComponentDidMount`.\n\nFor example, the `look-at` component's `init` handler sets up some variables:\n\n    ::js\n    init: function () {\n      this.target3D = null;\n      this.vector = new THREE.Vector3();\n    },\n\n    // ...\n\nExample uses of `init` by some of the standard A-Frame components:\n\n| Component     | Usage |\n| ---------     | ----- |\n| camera        | Create and set a THREE.PerspectiveCamera on the entity. |\n| cursor        | Attach event listeners. |\n| light         | Register light to the lighting system. |\n| look-at       | Create a helper vector. |\n| material      | Set up variables, mainly to visualize the state of the component. |\n| wasd-controls | Set up an object to keep track of pressed keys. Bind methods. |\n\n### Component.update(oldData) - Do the Magic\n\nThe `update` handler is called both at the beginning of the component's\nlifecycle with the initial `this.data` *and* every time the component's data\nchanges (generally during the entity's `attributeChangedCallback` like with a\n`setAttribute`). The update handler gets access to the previous state of the\ncomponent data passed in through `oldData`. The previous state of the component\ncan be used to tell exactly which properties changed to do more granular\nupdates.\n\nThe update handler uses `this.data` to modify the entity, usually interacting\nwith three.js APIs. One of the simplest update handlers is the\n[visible][visible] component's:\n\n    ::js\n    update: function () {\n      this.el.object3D.visible = this.data;\n    }\n\nA slightly more complex update handler might be the [light][light] component's,\nwhich we'll show via abbreviated code:\n\n    ::js\n    update: function (oldData) {\n      var diffData = diff(data, oldData || {});\n\n      if (this.light && !('type' in diffData)) {\n        // If there is an existing light and the type hasn't changed, update light.\n        Object.keys(diffData).forEach(function (property) {\n          light[property] = diffData[property];\n        });\n      } else {\n        // No light exists yet or the type of light has changed, create a new light.\n        this.light = this.getLight(this.data));\n\n        // Register the object3D of type `light` to the entity.\n        this.el.setObject3D('light', this.light);\n      }\n    }\n\nThe entity's `object3D` is a plain THREE.Object3D. Other three.js object types\nsuch as meshes, lights, and cameras can be set with `setObject3D` where they\nwill be appeneded to the entity's `object3D`.\n\nExample uses of `update` by some of the standard A-Frame components:\n\n| Component     | Usage |\n| ---------     | ----- |\n| camera        | Set THREE.PerspectiveCamera object properties such as aspect ratio, fov, or near/far clipping planes. |\n| look-at       | Set or update target entity to track the position of.\n| material      | If component is just attaching, create a material. If shader has not changed, update material. If shader has changed, replace the material.\n| wasd-controls | Update the position based on the current velocity. Update the velocity based on the keys pressed.\n\n### Component.remove() - Tear Down\n\nThe `remove` handler is called when the component detaches from the entity such\nas with `removeAttribute`. This is generally used to remove all modifications,\nlisteners, and behaviors to the entity that the component added.\n\nFor example, when the [light component][light] detaches, it removes the light\nit previously attached from the entity and thus the scene:\n\n    ::js\n    remove: function () {\n      this.el.removeObject3D('light');\n    }\n\nExample uses of `remove` by some of the standard A-Frame components:\n\n| Component     | Usage |\n| ---------     | ----- |\n| camera        | Remove the THREE.PerspectiveCamera from the entity. |\n| geometry      | Set a plain THREE.Geometry on the mesh. |\n| material      | Set a default THREE.MeshBasicMaterial on the mesh and unregister material from the system. |\n| wasd-controls | Remove keydown and keyup listeners. |\n\n### Component.tick(time) - Background Behavior\n\nThe `tick` handler is called on every single tick or render loop of the scene.\nSo expect it to run on the order of 60-120 times for second. The global uptime of\nthe scene in seconds is passed into the tick handler.\n\nFor example, the [look-at][look-at] component, which instructs an entity to\nlook at another target entity, uses the tick handler to update the rotation in\ncase the target entity changes its position:\n\n    ::js\n    tick: function (t) {\n      // target3D and vector are set from the update handler.\n      if (this.target3D) {\n        this.el.object3D.lookAt(this.vector.setFromMatrixPosition(target3D.matrixWorld));\n      }\n    }\n\nExample uses of `tick` by some of the standard A-Frame components:\n\n| Component     | Usage |\n| ---------     | ----- |\n| look-at       | Update rotation of entity to face towards tracked target, in case the target is moving.\n| physics       | Update the physics world simulation.\n| wasd-controls | Use current velocity to move the entity (generally the camera), update velocity if keys are pressed.\n\n### Component.pause() and Component.play() - Stop and Go\n\nTo support pause and play, just as with a video game or to toggle entities for\nperformance, components can implement `play` and `pause` handlers. These are\ninvoked when the component's entity runs its `play` or `pause` method. When an\nentity plays or pauses, all of its child entities are also played or paused.\n\nComponents should implement play or pause handlers if they register any\ndynamic, asynchronous, or background behavior such as animations, event\nlisteners, or tick handlers.\n\nFor example, the `look-controls` component simply removes its event listeners\nsuch that the camera does not move when the scene is paused, and it adds its\nevent listeners when the scene starts playing or is resumed:\n\n    ::js\n    pause: function () {\n      this.removeEventListeners()\n    },\n\n    play: function () {\n      this.addEventListeners()\n    }\n\nExample uses of `pause` and `play` by some of the standard A-Frame components:\n\n| Component     | Usage |\n| ---------     | ----- |\n| sound         | Pause/play sound.\n| wasd-controls | Remove/attach event listeners.\n\n## Boilerplate\n\nI suggest that people start off with my [component boilerplate][boilerplate],\neven hardcore tool junkies. This will get you straight into building a\ncomponent and comes with everything you will need to publish your component\ninto the wild. The boilerplate handles creating a stubbed component, build\nsteps for both NPM and browser distribution files, and publishing to Github\nPages.\n\nGenerally with boilerplates, it is better to start from scratch and build your\nown boilerplate, but the A-Frame component boilerplate contains a lot of tribal\ninside knowledge about A-Frame and is updated frequently to reflect new things\nlanding on A-Frame. The only possibly opinionated pieces about the boilerplate\nis the development tools it internally uses that are hidden away by NPM\nscripts.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Line Component\n\nLet's go through building a basic complete component, a *line* component. This\nline component will simply render a line. We will make it the component\nflexible to be able to specify the vertices and color.\n\n> Play with this [example line component in Codepen](https://codepen.io/team/mozvr/pen/yeEQNG).\n\n#### Line Component - Skeleton\n\nHere is a high-level view of the skeleton of the component, without the meat.\nFor this component, we'll need the `schema`, as all components require, the\n`update` handler, and the `remove` handler. The rest of the lifecycle method\nhandlers aren't necessary.\n\n    ::js\n    var coordinates = AFRAME.utils.coordinates;\n\n    AFRAME.registerComponent('line', {\n      // Allow line component to accept vertices and color.\n      schema: {},\n\n      // Create or update the line geometry.\n      update: {},\n\n      // Remove the line geometry.\n      remove: {}\n    });\n\n#### Line Component -Schema\n\nSince we have two properties we want to accept, `color` and `path`, we will\nneed a multi-property schema. The `color` property will just be a simple string\nthat will be fed to `THREE.Color` which does a lot of work for us. The `path`\nproperty will need a custom property type to parse an array of `vec3`s. That\nproperty type does not exist as a built-in type yet, but we can define an\ninline parse and stringifier.\n\n    ::js\n      // Allow line component to accept vertices and color.\n      schema: {\n        color: { default: '#333' },\n\n        path: {\n          default: [\n            { x: -0.5, y: 0, z: 0 },\n            { x: 0.5, y: 0, z: 0 }\n          ],\n\n          // Deserialize path in the form of comma-separated vec3s: `0 0 0, 1 1 1, 2 0 3`.\n          parse: function (value) {\n            return value.split(',').map(coordinates.parse);\n          },\n\n          // Serialize array of vec3s in case someone does\n          // setAttribute('line', 'path', [...]).\n          stringify: function (data) {\n            return data.map(coordinates.stringify).join(',');\n          }\n        }\n      },\n\n      //...\n\nThe component API is entirely up to us. If we wanted the path to take a\ndifferent syntax or abstract it further such that it maybe only accepts a\nstarting point and a length and handle the math for the developer, that is our\nperogative to permissionlessly implement.\n\nThe schema will handle the shape of the data so by the time it gets to the\nlifecycle handlers, it will be in a nice data structure.\n\n#### Line Component - Update\n\nThe `update` handler is called both on component attach and on the entity's\n`attributeChangedCallback`. In the update for the line component, we want to\nreate a line geometry if it doesn't exist yet, or update it if it does. We can\ncreate a line in `three.js` by combining a `THREE.LineBasicMaterial` and\n`THREE.Geometry` and manually pushing vertices.\n\n    ::js\n    update: function (oldData) {\n      // Set color with material.\n      var material = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({\n        color: this.data.color\n      });\n\n      // Add vertices to geometry.\n      var geometry = new THREE.Geometry();\n      this.data.path.forEach(function (vec3) {\n        geometry.vertices.push(\n          new THREE.Vector3(vec3.x, vec3.y, vec3.z)\n        );\n      });\n\n      // Apply mesh.\n      this.el.setObject3D('mesh', new THREE.Line(geometry, material));\n    },\n\n    // ...\n\nFor simplicity, we can just update the line by completely replacing it. In\nother components, we might want to more granularly update objects for\nperformance.\n\nWhen we set the object with `setObject3D`, we specify the object type. In this\ncase, it is a `mesh`, which is a geometry combined with a material. Other\nobject types might be `light` or `camera`. `setObject3D` just puts the object\ninto a map and appends the object under the entity's scene graph\n(`THREE.Group`).\n\n#### Line Component - Remove\n\nFor removal, we can just use `removeObject3D`:\n\n    ::js\n    remove: function () {\n      this.el.removeObject3D('mesh');\n    }\n\nThis will remove the object from the entity's scene graph.\n\n#### Line Component - Usage\n\nThen we with the line component written and registered, we can use it in HTML:\n\n    ::html\n    <a-scene>\n      <a-assets>\n        <a-mixin id=\"red\" line=\"color: #E20049\"></a-mixin>\n      </a-assets>\n\n      <a-entity id=\"happy-face\" position=\"0 2 -10\">\n        <a-entity mixin=\"red\" line=\"path: -1 1 0, -1 0.5 0, -1 0 0\"></a-entity>\n        <a-entity mixin=\"red\" line=\"path: 1 1 0, 1 0.5 0, 1 0 0\"></a-entity>\n        <a-entity mixin=\"red\" line=\"path: -2 -1 0, 0 -2 0, 2 -1\"></a-entity>\n      </a-entity>\n\n      <a-sky color=\"#FFEED0\"></a-sky>\n    </a-scene>\n\nAnd voila!\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/icggby2.jpg)\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\n  Happy face with the line component!

This\ndata is used to modify the entity. For example, we might have an <em>engine</em>\ncomponent.

In A-Frame, we register and configure a component to an entity\nusing an HTML attribute and a style-like syntax:</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;a-entity light=&quot;type: point; color: crimson; intensity: 2.5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;\n</code></pre><p>This would give us a light in the scene. To demonstrate composability, we could\ngive the light a spherical representation by mixing in the <a href=\"https://aframe.io/docs/components/geometry.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">geometry\ncomponent</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;a-entity geometry=&quot;primitive: sphere; radius: 5&quot;\n          light=&quot;type: point; color: crimson; intensity: 2.5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Or we can configure the position component to move the light sphere a bit to the right.</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;a-entity geometry=&quot;primitive: sphere; radius: 5&quot;\n          light=&quot;type: point; color: crimson; intensity: 2.5&quot;\n          position=&quot;5 0 0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Given the style-like syntax and that it modifies the appearance and behavior of\nDOM nodes, component properties can be thought of as a rough analog to CSS. In\nthe near future, I can imagine component property stylesheets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Under-the-Hood\"><a href=\"#Under-the-Hood\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Under the Hood\"></a>Under the Hood</h3><p>Now let’s see what a component looks like <strong>under the hood</strong>. A-Frame’s most\nbasic component is the <a href=\"https://aframe.io/docs/components/position.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">position component</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nAFRAME.registerComponent(&apos;position&apos;, {\n  schema: { type: &apos;vec3&apos; },\n\n  update: function () {\n    var object3D = this.el.object3D;\n    var data = this.data;\n    object3D.position.set(data.x, data.y, data.z);\n  }\n});\n</code></pre><p>The position component uses only a tiny subset of the component API, but what\nthis does is register the component with the name “position”, define a <code>schema</code>\nwhere the component’s value with be parsed to an <code>{x, y, z}</code> object, and when\nthe component initializes or the component’s data updates, set the position of\nthe entity with the <code>update</code> callback. <code>this.el</code> is a reference from the\ncomponent to the DOM element, or entity, and <code>object3D</code> is the entity’s\n<a href=\"http://threejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">three.js</a>. Note that A-Frame is built on top of three.js so many\ncomponents will be using the three.js API.</p>\n<p>So we see that components consist of a name and a definition, and then they can\nbe registered to A-Frame. We saw the the position component definition defined\na <code>schema</code> and an <code>update</code> handler. Components simply consist of the <code>schema</code>,\nwhich defines the shape of the data, and several handlers for the component to\nmodify the entity in reaction to different types of events.</p>\n<p>Here is the current list of properties and methods of a component definition:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Property</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>data</td>\n<td>Data of the component derived from the schema default values, mixins, and the entity’s attributes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>el</td>\n<td>Reference to the <a href=\"https://aframe.io/docs/core/entity.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">entity</a> element.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>schema</td>\n<td>Names, types, and default values of the component property value(s).</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Method</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>init</td>\n<td>Called once when the component is initialized.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>update</td>\n<td>Called both when the component is initialized and whenever the component’s data changes (e.g, via <em>setAttribute</em>).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>remove</td>\n<td>Called when the component detaches from the element (e.g., via <em>removeAttribute</em>).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>tick</td>\n<td>Called on each render loop or tick of the scene.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>play</td>\n<td>Called whenever the scene or entity plays to add any background or dynamic behavior.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>pause</td>\n<td>Called whenever the scene or entity pauses to remove any background or dynamic behavior.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Defining-the-Schema\"><a href=\"#Defining-the-Schema\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Defining the Schema\"></a>Defining the Schema</h2><p>The component’s schema defines what type of data it takes. A component can\neither be single-property or consist of multiple properties. And properties\nhave <em>property types</em>. Note that single-property schemas and property types are\nbeing released in A-Frame <code>v0.2.0</code>.</p>\n<p>A property might look like:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\n{ type: &apos;int&apos;, default: 5 }\n</code></pre><p>And a schema consisting of multiple properties might look like:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\n{\n  color: { default: &apos;#FFF&apos; },\n  target: { type: &apos;selector&apos; },\n  uv: {\n    default: &apos;1 1&apos;,\n    parse: function (value) {\n      return value.split(&apos; &apos;).map(parseFloat);\n    }\n  },\n}\n</code></pre><p>Since components in the entity-component system are just buckets of data that\nare used to affect the appearance or behavior of the entity, the schema plays a\ncrucial role in the definition of the component.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Property-Types\"><a href=\"#Property-Types\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Property Types\"></a>Property Types</h3><p>A-Frame comes with several built-in property types such as <code>boolean</code>, <code>int</code>,\n<code>number</code>, <code>selector</code>, <code>string</code>, or <code>vec3</code>. Every single property is assigned a\ntype, whether explicitly through the <code>type</code> key or implictly via inferring the\nvalue. And each type is used to assign <code>parse</code> and <code>stringify</code> functions. The\nparser deserializes the incoming string value from the DOM to be put into the\ncomponent’s data object. The stringifier is used when using <code>setAttribute</code> to\nserialize back to the DOM.</p>\n<p>We can actually define and register our own property types:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nAFRAME.registerPropertyType(&apos;radians&apos;, {\n  parse: function () {\n\n  }\n\n  // Default stringify is .toString().\n});\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"Single-Property-Schemas\"><a href=\"#Single-Property-Schemas\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Single-Property Schemas\"></a>Single-Property Schemas</h3><p>If a component has only one property, then it must either have a <code>type</code> or a\n<code>default</code> value. If the type is defined, then the type is used to parse and\ncoerce the string retrieved from the DOM (e.g., <code>getAttribute</code>). Or if the\ndefault value is defined, the default value is used to infer the type.</p>\n<p>Take for instance the <a href=\"https://aframe.io/docs/components/visible.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">visible component</a>. The schema property\ndefinition implicitly defines it as a boolean:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nAFRAME.registerComponent(&apos;visible&apos;, {\n  schema: {\n    // Type will be inferred to be boolean.\n    default: true\n  },\n\n  // ...\n});\n</code></pre><p>Or the <a href=\"https://aframe.io/docs/components/rotation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">rotation component</a> which explicitly defines the value as a <code>vec3</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nAFRAME.registerComponent(&apos;rotation&apos;, {\n  schema: {\n    // Default value will be 0, 0, 0 as defined by the vec3 property type.\n    type: &apos;vec3&apos;\n  }\n\n  // ...\n});\n</code></pre><p>Using these defined property types, schemas are processed by\n<code>registerComponent</code> to inject default values, parsers, and stringifiers for\neach property. So if a default value is not defined, the default value will be\nwhatever the property type defines as the “default default value”.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Multiple-Property-Schemas\"><a href=\"#Multiple-Property-Schemas\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Multiple-Property Schemas\"></a>Multiple-Property Schemas</h3><p>If a component has multiple properties (or one named property), then it consists of\none or more property definitions, in the form described above, in an object keyed by\nproperty name. For instance, a physics body component might define a schema:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nAFRAME.registerComponent(&apos;physics-body&apos;, {\n  schema: {\n    boundingBox: {\n      type: &apos;vec3&apos;,\n      default: { x: 1, y: 1, z: 1 }\n    },\n    mass: {\n      default: 0\n    },\n    velocity: {\n      type: &apos;vec3&apos;\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>Having multiple properties is what makes the component take the syntax in the\nform of <code>physics=&quot;mass: 2; velocity: 1 1 1&quot;</code>.</p>\n<p>With the schema defined, all data coming into the component will be passed\nthrough the schema for parsing. Then in the lifecycle methods, the component\nhas access to <code>this.data</code> which in a single-property schema is a value and in a\nmultiple-propery schema is an object.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Defining-the-Lifecycle-Methods\"><a href=\"#Defining-the-Lifecycle-Methods\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Defining the Lifecycle Methods\"></a>Defining the Lifecycle Methods</h2><h3 id=\"Component-init-Set-Up\"><a href=\"#Component-init-Set-Up\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Component.init() - Set Up\"></a>Component.init() - Set Up</h3><p><code>init</code> is called once in the component’s lifecycle when it is mounted to the\nentity. <code>init</code> is generally used to set up variables or members that may used\nthroughout the component or to set up state. Though not every component will\nneed to define an <code>init</code> handler. Sort of like the component-equivalent method\nto <code>createdCallback</code> or <code>React.ComponentDidMount</code>.</p>\n<p>For example, the <code>look-at</code> component’s <code>init</code> handler sets up some variables:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\ninit: function () {\n  this.target3D = null;\n  this.vector = new THREE.Vector3();\n},\n\n// ...\n</code></pre><p>Example uses of <code>init</code> by some of the standard A-Frame components:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Usage</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>camera</td>\n<td>Create and set a THREE.PerspectiveCamera on the entity.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>cursor</td>\n<td>Attach event listeners.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>light</td>\n<td>Register light to the lighting system.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>look-at</td>\n<td>Create a helper vector.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>material</td>\n<td>Set up variables, mainly to visualize the state of the component.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wasd-controls</td>\n<td>Set up an object to keep track of pressed keys.

The update handler gets access to the previous state of the\ncomponent data passed in through <code>oldData</code>. The previous state of the component\ncan be used to tell exactly which properties changed to do more granular\nupdates.</p>\n<p>The update handler uses <code>this.data</code> to modify the entity, usually interacting\nwith three.js APIs. One of the simplest update handlers is the\n<a href=\"https://aframe.io/docs/components/visible.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">visible</a> component’s:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nupdate: function () {\n  this.el.object3D.visible = this.data;\n}\n</code></pre><p>A slightly more complex update handler might be the <a href=\"https://aframe.io/docs/components/light.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">light</a> component’s,\nwhich we’ll show via abbreviated code:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nupdate: function (oldData) {\n  var diffData = diff(data, oldData || {});\n\n  if (this.light &amp;&amp; !(&apos;type&apos; in diffData)) {\n    // If there is an existing light and the type hasn&apos;t changed, update light.\n    Object.keys(diffData).forEach(function (property) {\n      light[property] = diffData[property];\n    });\n  } else {\n    // No light exists yet or the type of light has changed, create a new light.\n    this.light = this.getLight(this.data));\n\n    // Register the object3D of type `light` to the entity.\n    this.el.setObject3D(&apos;light&apos;, this.light);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>The entity’s <code>object3D</code> is a plain THREE.Object3D.

When an\nentity plays or pauses, all of its child entities are also played or paused.</p>\n<p>Components should implement play or pause handlers if they register any\ndynamic, asynchronous, or background behavior such as animations, event\nlisteners, or tick handlers.</p>\n<p>For example, the <code>look-controls</code> component simply removes its event listeners\nsuch that the camera does not move when the scene is paused, and it adds its\nevent listeners when the scene starts playing or is resumed:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\npause: function () {\n  this.removeEventListeners()\n},\n\nplay: function () {\n  this.addEventListeners()\n}\n</code></pre><p>Example uses of <code>pause</code> and <code>play</code> by some of the standard A-Frame components:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Usage</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>sound</td>\n<td>Pause/play sound.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wasd-controls</td>\n<td>Remove/attach event listeners.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Boilerplate\"><a href=\"#Boilerplate\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Boilerplate\"></a>Boilerplate</h2><p>I suggest that people start off with my <a href=\"https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-component-boilerplate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">component boilerplate</a>,\neven hardcore tool junkies.

The <code>path</code>\nproperty will need a custom property type to parse an array of <code>vec3</code>s. That\nproperty type does not exist as a built-in type yet, but we can define an\ninline parse and stringifier.</p>\n<pre><code>::js\n  // Allow line component to accept vertices and color.\n  schema: {\n    color: { default: &apos;#333&apos; },\n\n    path: {\n      default: [\n        { x: -0.5, y: 0, z: 0 },\n        { x: 0.5, y: 0, z: 0 }\n      ],\n\n      // Deserialize path in the form of comma-separated vec3s: `0 0 0, 1 1 1, 2 0 3`.\n      parse: function (value) {\n        return value.split(&apos;,&apos;).map(coordinates.parse);\n      },\n\n      // Serialize array of vec3s in case someone does\n      // setAttribute(&apos;line&apos;, &apos;path&apos;, [...]).\n      stringify: function (data) {\n        return data.map(coordinates.stringify).join(&apos;,&apos;);\n      }\n    }\n  },\n\n  //...\n</code></pre><p>The component API is entirely up to us. If we wanted the path to take a\ndifferent syntax or abstract it further such that it maybe only accepts a\nstarting point and a length and handle the math for the developer, that is our\nperogative to permissionlessly implement.</p>\n<p>The schema will handle the shape of the data so by the time it gets to the\nlifecycle handlers, it will be in a nice data structure.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Line-Component-Update\"><a href=\"#Line-Component-Update\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Line Component - Update\"></a>Line Component - Update</h4><p>The <code>update</code> handler is called both on component attach and on the entity’s\n<code>attributeChangedCallback</code>. In the update for the line component, we want to\nreate a line geometry if it doesn’t exist yet, or update it if it does. We can\ncreate a line in <code>three.js</code> by combining a <code>THREE.LineBasicMaterial</code> and\n<code>THREE.Geometry</code> and manually pushing vertices.</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nupdate: function (oldData) {\n  // Set color with material.\n  var material = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({\n    color: this.data.color\n  });\n\n  // Add vertices to geometry.\n  var geometry = new THREE.Geometry();\n  this.data.path.forEach(function (vec3) {\n    geometry.vertices.push(\n      new THREE.Vector3(vec3.x, vec3.y, vec3.z)\n    );\n  });\n\n  // Apply mesh.\n  this.el.setObject3D(&apos;mesh&apos;, new THREE.Line(geometry, material));\n},\n\n// ...\n</code></pre><p>For simplicity, we can just update the line by completely replacing it. In\nother components, we might want to more granularly update objects for\nperformance.</p>\n<p>When we set the object with <code>setObject3D</code>, we specify the object type. In this\ncase, it is a <code>mesh</code>, which is a geometry combined with a material. Other\nobject types might be <code>light</code> or <code>camera</code>. <code>setObject3D</code> just puts the object\ninto a map and appends the object under the entity’s scene graph\n(<code>THREE.Group</code>).</p>\n<h4 id=\"Line-Component-Remove\"><a href=\"#Line-Component-Remove\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Line Component - Remove\"></a>Line Component - Remove</h4><p>For removal, we can just use <code>removeObject3D</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nremove: function () {\n  this.el.removeObject3D(&apos;mesh&apos;);\n}\n</code></pre><p>This will remove the object from the entity’s scene graph.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Line-Component-Usage\"><a href=\"#Line-Component-Usage\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Line Component - Usage\"></a>Line Component - Usage</h4><p>Then we with the line component written and registered, we can use it in HTML:</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;a-scene&gt;\n  &lt;a-assets&gt;\n    &lt;a-mixin id=&quot;red&quot; line=&quot;color: #E20049&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-mixin&gt;\n  &lt;/a-assets&gt;\n\n  &lt;a-entity id=&quot;happy-face&quot; position=&quot;0 2 -10&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;a-entity mixin=&quot;red&quot; line=&quot;path: -1 1 0, -1 0.5 0, -1 0 0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;\n    &lt;a-entity mixin=&quot;red&quot; line=&quot;path: 1 1 0, 1 0.5 0, 1 0 0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;\n    &lt;a-entity mixin=&quot;red&quot; line=&quot;path: -2 -1 0, 0 -2 0, 2 -1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;\n  &lt;/a-entity&gt;\n\n  &lt;a-sky color=&quot;#FFEED0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-sky&gt;\n&lt;/a-scene&gt;\n</code></pre><p>And voila!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/icggby2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\n  Happy face with the line component!

In A-Frame, we register and configure a component to an entity\nusing an HTML attribute and a style-like syntax:</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;a-entity light=&quot;type: point; color: crimson; intensity: 2.5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;\n</code></pre><p>This would give us a light in the scene. To demonstrate composability, we could\ngive the light a spherical representation by mixing in the <a href=\"https://aframe.io/docs/components/geometry.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">geometry\ncomponent</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;a-entity geometry=&quot;primitive: sphere; radius: 5&quot;\n          light=&quot;type: point; color: crimson; intensity: 2.5&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Or we can configure the position component to move the light sphere a bit to the right.</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;a-entity geometry=&quot;primitive: sphere; radius: 5&quot;\n          light=&quot;type: point; color: crimson; intensity: 2.5&quot;\n          position=&quot;5 0 0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;\n</code></pre><p>Given the style-like syntax and that it modifies the appearance and behavior of\nDOM nodes, component properties can be thought of as a rough analog to CSS. In\nthe near future, I can imagine component property stylesheets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Under-the-Hood\"><a href=\"#Under-the-Hood\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Under the Hood\"></a>Under the Hood</h3><p>Now let’s see what a component looks like <strong>under the hood</strong>. A-Frame’s most\nbasic component is the <a href=\"https://aframe.io/docs/components/position.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">position component</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nAFRAME.registerComponent(&apos;position&apos;, {\n  schema: { type: &apos;vec3&apos; },\n\n  update: function () {\n    var object3D = this.el.object3D;\n    var data = this.data;\n    object3D.position.set(data.x, data.y, data.z);\n  }\n});\n</code></pre><p>The position component uses only a tiny subset of the component API, but what\nthis does is register the component with the name “position”, define a <code>schema</code>\nwhere the component’s value with be parsed to an <code>{x, y, z}</code> object, and when\nthe component initializes or the component’s data updates, set the position of\nthe entity with the <code>update</code> callback. <code>this.el</code> is a reference from the\ncomponent to the DOM element, or entity, and <code>object3D</code> is the entity’s\n<a href=\"http://threejs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">three.js</a>. Note that A-Frame is built on top of three.js so many\ncomponents will be using the three.js API.</p>\n<p>So we see that components consist of a name and a definition, and then they can\nbe registered to A-Frame. We saw the the position component definition defined\na <code>schema</code> and an <code>update</code> handler. Components simply consist of the <code>schema</code>,\nwhich defines the shape of the data, and several handlers for the component to\nmodify the entity in reaction to different types of events.</p>\n<p>Here is the current list of properties and methods of a component definition:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Property</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>data</td>\n<td>Data of the component derived from the schema default values, mixins, and the entity’s attributes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>el</td>\n<td>Reference to the <a href=\"https://aframe.io/docs/core/entity.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">entity</a> element.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>schema</td>\n<td>Names, types, and default values of the component property value(s).</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Method</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>init</td>\n<td>Called once when the component is initialized.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>update</td>\n<td>Called both when the component is initialized and whenever the component’s data changes (e.g, via <em>setAttribute</em>).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>remove</td>\n<td>Called when the component detaches from the element (e.g., via <em>removeAttribute</em>).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>tick</td>\n<td>Called on each render loop or tick of the scene.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>play</td>\n<td>Called whenever the scene or entity plays to add any background or dynamic behavior.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>pause</td>\n<td>Called whenever the scene or entity pauses to remove any background or dynamic behavior.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Defining-the-Schema\"><a href=\"#Defining-the-Schema\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Defining the Schema\"></a>Defining the Schema</h2><p>The component’s schema defines what type of data it takes. A component can\neither be single-property or consist of multiple properties. And properties\nhave <em>property types</em>. Note that single-property schemas and property types are\nbeing released in A-Frame <code>v0.2.0</code>.</p>\n<p>A property might look like:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\n{ type: &apos;int&apos;, default: 5 }\n</code></pre><p>And a schema consisting of multiple properties might look like:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\n{\n  color: { default: &apos;#FFF&apos; },\n  target: { type: &apos;selector&apos; },\n  uv: {\n    default: &apos;1 1&apos;,\n    parse: function (value) {\n      return value.split(&apos; &apos;).map(parseFloat);\n    }\n  },\n}\n</code></pre><p>Since components in the entity-component system are just buckets of data that\nare used to affect the appearance or behavior of the entity, the schema plays a\ncrucial role in the definition of the component.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Property-Types\"><a href=\"#Property-Types\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Property Types\"></a>Property Types</h3><p>A-Frame comes with several built-in property types such as <code>boolean</code>, <code>int</code>,\n<code>number</code>, <code>selector</code>, <code>string</code>, or <code>vec3</code>. Every single property is assigned a\ntype, whether explicitly through the <code>type</code> key or implictly via inferring the\nvalue. And each type is used to assign <code>parse</code> and <code>stringify</code> functions. The\nparser deserializes the incoming string value from the DOM to be put into the\ncomponent’s data object. The stringifier is used when using <code>setAttribute</code> to\nserialize back to the DOM.</p>\n<p>We can actually define and register our own property types:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nAFRAME.registerPropertyType(&apos;radians&apos;, {\n  parse: function () {\n\n  }\n\n  // Default stringify is .toString().\n});\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"Single-Property-Schemas\"><a href=\"#Single-Property-Schemas\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Single-Property Schemas\"></a>Single-Property Schemas</h3><p>If a component has only one property, then it must either have a <code>type</code> or a\n<code>default</code> value. If the type is defined, then the type is used to parse and\ncoerce the string retrieved from the DOM (e.g., <code>getAttribute</code>). Or if the\ndefault value is defined, the default value is used to infer the type.</p>\n<p>Take for instance the <a href=\"https://aframe.io/docs/components/visible.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">visible component</a>. The schema property\ndefinition implicitly defines it as a boolean:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nAFRAME.registerComponent(&apos;visible&apos;, {\n  schema: {\n    // Type will be inferred to be boolean.\n    default: true\n  },\n\n  // ...\n});\n</code></pre><p>Or the <a href=\"https://aframe.io/docs/components/rotation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">rotation component</a> which explicitly defines the value as a <code>vec3</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nAFRAME.registerComponent(&apos;rotation&apos;, {\n  schema: {\n    // Default value will be 0, 0, 0 as defined by the vec3 property type.\n    type: &apos;vec3&apos;\n  }\n\n  // ...\n});\n</code></pre><p>Using these defined property types, schemas are processed by\n<code>registerComponent</code> to inject default values, parsers, and stringifiers for\neach property. So if a default value is not defined, the default value will be\nwhatever the property type defines as the “default default value”.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Multiple-Property-Schemas\"><a href=\"#Multiple-Property-Schemas\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Multiple-Property Schemas\"></a>Multiple-Property Schemas</h3><p>If a component has multiple properties (or one named property), then it consists of\none or more property definitions, in the form described above, in an object keyed by\nproperty name. For instance, a physics body component might define a schema:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nAFRAME.registerComponent(&apos;physics-body&apos;, {\n  schema: {\n    boundingBox: {\n      type: &apos;vec3&apos;,\n      default: { x: 1, y: 1, z: 1 }\n    },\n    mass: {\n      default: 0\n    },\n    velocity: {\n      type: &apos;vec3&apos;\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>Having multiple properties is what makes the component take the syntax in the\nform of <code>physics=&quot;mass: 2; velocity: 1 1 1&quot;</code>.</p>\n<p>With the schema defined, all data coming into the component will be passed\nthrough the schema for parsing. Then in the lifecycle methods, the component\nhas access to <code>this.data</code> which in a single-property schema is a value and in a\nmultiple-propery schema is an object.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Defining-the-Lifecycle-Methods\"><a href=\"#Defining-the-Lifecycle-Methods\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Defining the Lifecycle Methods\"></a>Defining the Lifecycle Methods</h2><h3 id=\"Component-init-Set-Up\"><a href=\"#Component-init-Set-Up\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Component.init() - Set Up\"></a>Component.init() - Set Up</h3><p><code>init</code> is called once in the component’s lifecycle when it is mounted to the\nentity. <code>init</code> is generally used to set up variables or members that may used\nthroughout the component or to set up state. Though not every component will\nneed to define an <code>init</code> handler. Sort of like the component-equivalent method\nto <code>createdCallback</code> or <code>React.ComponentDidMount</code>.</p>\n<p>For example, the <code>look-at</code> component’s <code>init</code> handler sets up some variables:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\ninit: function () {\n  this.target3D = null;\n  this.vector = new THREE.Vector3();\n},\n\n// ...\n</code></pre><p>Example uses of <code>init</code> by some of the standard A-Frame components:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Usage</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>camera</td>\n<td>Create and set a THREE.PerspectiveCamera on the entity.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>cursor</td>\n<td>Attach event listeners.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>light</td>\n<td>Register light to the lighting system.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>look-at</td>\n<td>Create a helper vector.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>material</td>\n<td>Set up variables, mainly to visualize the state of the component.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wasd-controls</td>\n<td>Set up an object to keep track of pressed keys.

The update handler gets access to the previous state of the\ncomponent data passed in through <code>oldData</code>. The previous state of the component\ncan be used to tell exactly which properties changed to do more granular\nupdates.</p>\n<p>The update handler uses <code>this.data</code> to modify the entity, usually interacting\nwith three.js APIs. One of the simplest update handlers is the\n<a href=\"https://aframe.io/docs/components/visible.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">visible</a> component’s:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nupdate: function () {\n  this.el.object3D.visible = this.data;\n}\n</code></pre><p>A slightly more complex update handler might be the <a href=\"https://aframe.io/docs/components/light.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">light</a> component’s,\nwhich we’ll show via abbreviated code:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nupdate: function (oldData) {\n  var diffData = diff(data, oldData || {});\n\n  if (this.light &amp;&amp; !(&apos;type&apos; in diffData)) {\n    // If there is an existing light and the type hasn&apos;t changed, update light.\n    Object.keys(diffData).forEach(function (property) {\n      light[property] = diffData[property];\n    });\n  } else {\n    // No light exists yet or the type of light has changed, create a new light.\n    this.light = this.getLight(this.data));\n\n    // Register the object3D of type `light` to the entity.\n    this.el.setObject3D(&apos;light&apos;, this.light);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>The entity’s <code>object3D</code> is a plain THREE.Object3D. Other three.js object types\nsuch as meshes, lights, and cameras can be set with <code>setObject3D</code> where they\nwill be appeneded to the entity’s <code>object3D</code>.</p>\n<p>Example uses of <code>update</code> by some of the standard A-Frame components:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Usage</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>camera</td>\n<td>Set THREE.PerspectiveCamera object properties such as aspect ratio, fov, or near/far clipping planes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>look-at</td>\n<td>Set or update target entity to track the position of.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>material</td>\n<td>If component is just attaching, create a material.

These are\ninvoked when the component’s entity runs its <code>play</code> or <code>pause</code> method. When an\nentity plays or pauses, all of its child entities are also played or paused.</p>\n<p>Components should implement play or pause handlers if they register any\ndynamic, asynchronous, or background behavior such as animations, event\nlisteners, or tick handlers.</p>\n<p>For example, the <code>look-controls</code> component simply removes its event listeners\nsuch that the camera does not move when the scene is paused, and it adds its\nevent listeners when the scene starts playing or is resumed:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\npause: function () {\n  this.removeEventListeners()\n},\n\nplay: function () {\n  this.addEventListeners()\n}\n</code></pre><p>Example uses of <code>pause</code> and <code>play</code> by some of the standard A-Frame components:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Component</th>\n<th>Usage</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>sound</td>\n<td>Pause/play sound.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wasd-controls</td>\n<td>Remove/attach event listeners.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2 id=\"Boilerplate\"><a href=\"#Boilerplate\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Boilerplate\"></a>Boilerplate</h2><p>I suggest that people start off with my <a href=\"https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-component-boilerplate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">component boilerplate</a>,\neven hardcore tool junkies. This will get you straight into building a\ncomponent and comes with everything you will need to publish your component\ninto the wild. The boilerplate handles creating a stubbed component, build\nsteps for both NPM and browser distribution files, and publishing to Github\nPages.</p>\n<p>Generally with boilerplates, it is better to start from scratch and build your\nown boilerplate, but the A-Frame component boilerplate contains a lot of tribal\ninside knowledge about A-Frame and is updated frequently to reflect new things\nlanding on A-Frame. The only possibly opinionated pieces about the boilerplate\nis the development tools it internally uses that are hidden away by NPM\nscripts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Examples\"><a href=\"#Examples\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Examples\"></a>Examples</h2><h3 id=\"Line-Component\"><a href=\"#Line-Component\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Line Component\"></a>Line Component</h3><p>Let’s go through building a basic complete component, a <em>line</em> component. This\nline component will simply render a line. We will make it the component\nflexible to be able to specify the vertices and color.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Play with this <a href=\"https://codepen.io/team/mozvr/pen/yeEQNG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">example line component in Codepen</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"Line-Component-Skeleton\"><a href=\"#Line-Component-Skeleton\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Line Component - Skeleton\"></a>Line Component - Skeleton</h4><p>Here is a high-level view of the skeleton of the component, without the meat.\nFor this component, we’ll need the <code>schema</code>, as all components require, the\n<code>update</code> handler, and the <code>remove</code> handler. The rest of the lifecycle method\nhandlers aren’t necessary.</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nvar coordinates = AFRAME.utils.coordinates;\n\nAFRAME.registerComponent(&apos;line&apos;, {\n  // Allow line component to accept vertices and color.\n  schema: {},\n\n  // Create or update the line geometry.\n  update: {},\n\n  // Remove the line geometry.\n  remove: {}\n});\n</code></pre><h4 id=\"Line-Component-Schema\"><a href=\"#Line-Component-Schema\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Line Component -Schema\"></a>Line Component -Schema</h4><p>Since we have two properties we want to accept, <code>color</code> and <code>path</code>, we will\nneed a multi-property schema. The <code>color</code> property will just be a simple string\nthat will be fed to <code>THREE.Color</code> which does a lot of work for us. The <code>path</code>\nproperty will need a custom property type to parse an array of <code>vec3</code>s. That\nproperty type does not exist as a built-in type yet, but we can define an\ninline parse and stringifier.</p>\n<pre><code>::js\n  // Allow line component to accept vertices and color.\n  schema: {\n    color: { default: &apos;#333&apos; },\n\n    path: {\n      default: [\n        { x: -0.5, y: 0, z: 0 },\n        { x: 0.5, y: 0, z: 0 }\n      ],\n\n      // Deserialize path in the form of comma-separated vec3s: `0 0 0, 1 1 1, 2 0 3`.\n      parse: function (value) {\n        return value.split(&apos;,&apos;).map(coordinates.parse);\n      },\n\n      // Serialize array of vec3s in case someone does\n      // setAttribute(&apos;line&apos;, &apos;path&apos;, [...]).\n      stringify: function (data) {\n        return data.map(coordinates.stringify).join(&apos;,&apos;);\n      }\n    }\n  },\n\n  //...\n</code></pre><p>The component API is entirely up to us. If we wanted the path to take a\ndifferent syntax or abstract it further such that it maybe only accepts a\nstarting point and a length and handle the math for the developer, that is our\nperogative to permissionlessly implement.</p>\n<p>The schema will handle the shape of the data so by the time it gets to the\nlifecycle handlers, it will be in a nice data structure.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Line-Component-Update\"><a href=\"#Line-Component-Update\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Line Component - Update\"></a>Line Component - Update</h4><p>The <code>update</code> handler is called both on component attach and on the entity’s\n<code>attributeChangedCallback</code>. In the update for the line component, we want to\nreate a line geometry if it doesn’t exist yet, or update it if it does. We can\ncreate a line in <code>three.js</code> by combining a <code>THREE.LineBasicMaterial</code> and\n<code>THREE.Geometry</code> and manually pushing vertices.</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nupdate: function (oldData) {\n  // Set color with material.\n  var material = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({\n    color: this.data.color\n  });\n\n  // Add vertices to geometry.\n  var geometry = new THREE.Geometry();\n  this.data.path.forEach(function (vec3) {\n    geometry.vertices.push(\n      new THREE.Vector3(vec3.x, vec3.y, vec3.z)\n    );\n  });\n\n  // Apply mesh.\n  this.el.setObject3D(&apos;mesh&apos;, new THREE.Line(geometry, material));\n},\n\n// ...\n</code></pre><p>For simplicity, we can just update the line by completely replacing it. In\nother components, we might want to more granularly update objects for\nperformance.</p>\n<p>When we set the object with <code>setObject3D</code>, we specify the object type. In this\ncase, it is a <code>mesh</code>, which is a geometry combined with a material. Other\nobject types might be <code>light</code> or <code>camera</code>. <code>setObject3D</code> just puts the object\ninto a map and appends the object under the entity’s scene graph\n(<code>THREE.Group</code>).</p>\n<h4 id=\"Line-Component-Remove\"><a href=\"#Line-Component-Remove\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Line Component - Remove\"></a>Line Component - Remove</h4><p>For removal, we can just use <code>removeObject3D</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>::js\nremove: function () {\n  this.el.removeObject3D(&apos;mesh&apos;);\n}\n</code></pre><p>This will remove the object from the entity’s scene graph.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Line-Component-Usage\"><a href=\"#Line-Component-Usage\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Line Component - Usage\"></a>Line Component - Usage</h4><p>Then we with the line component written and registered, we can use it in HTML:</p>\n<pre><code>::html\n&lt;a-scene&gt;\n  &lt;a-assets&gt;\n    &lt;a-mixin id=&quot;red&quot; line=&quot;color: #E20049&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-mixin&gt;\n  &lt;/a-assets&gt;\n\n  &lt;a-entity id=&quot;happy-face&quot; position=&quot;0 2 -10&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;a-entity mixin=&quot;red&quot; line=&quot;path: -1 1 0, -1 0.5 0, -1 0 0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;\n    &lt;a-entity mixin=&quot;red&quot; line=&quot;path: 1 1 0, 1 0.5 0, 1 0 0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;\n    &lt;a-entity mixin=&quot;red&quot; line=&quot;path: -2 -1 0, 0 -2 0, 2 -1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-entity&gt;\n  &lt;/a-entity&gt;\n\n  &lt;a-sky color=&quot;#FFEED0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a-sky&gt;\n&lt;/a-scene&gt;\n</code></pre><p>And voila!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/icggby2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"page-caption\"><span>\n  Happy face with the line component!
