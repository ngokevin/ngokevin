Played at the Encore after work. The 6pm $500 guaranteed. I like to play 30-man
SNGs but unfortunately only 14 showed up that night.  Single table SNGs aren't
my strong suit as only 3 places pay out, and bubble play becomes tighter. I
love aggressive bubble play, but there's little place for that here. Towards
the end, I got it in two times in a row a 9:1 favorite and got sucked out on
both times. 7th place sadness.

Some older guy asked whether or not I dyed my hair and joked he would like to
change to my style.

## Session Conclusions

AA vs 58o on a 234 board, AQ vs QT preflop are no good.

- **Went Well:** thinking about good flops to check back (KQ on a AKx board)
- **Mistakes:** got a bit spewy after the suck outs and tried to punish + bluff OOP too large
- **Get Better At**: less results-oriented thinking, thicker skin
- **Profit**: -$60
