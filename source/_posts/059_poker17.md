Back from an overnight flight from AK with a healthy dose of lack-of-sleep with
a drop of jetlag. Against better judgement, I headed to [Final
Table](http://pokerportland.com) to play the 11am freeroll. It was one of the
first times I played with my hoodie up, but it wasn't to hide my poker face; it
was to create a happy place where I could close my eyes. I cashed 5th out of 30
for $65. Interestingly, the owner of the club jumped in with a $200 bounty,
stating his earnings would go to the dealers.

## 11am $200 Freeroll - 5th for $65

I played extremely tight and nitty. Being tired, I didn't want to get myself
into marginal situations. Though this made myself even more tired from the
boredom of waiting for good hands in good positions, but I kept patience.
People verbally caught on how tight I was playing but I wasn't able to take
advantage of that table image, not finding good spots to steal.

The $200 bounty on the owner caused a lot of action, action that you might find
playing the <a href="https://www.caesarscasino.com/en/all-games" ref="nofollow">best online casino games</a>.

Busted with 77 vs 88 after 4 hours of play and my girlfriend waiting
restlessly.  $35 profit / 4hrs = $8.75/hr, good for minimum wage. Time to go
get some [Big
Macs](http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/food/product_nutrition.sandwiches.255.big-mac.html)

## Session Conclusion

- **Went Well:** patience
- **Mistakes:** open-folding AJo UTG+1 in push-shove play with M=3
- **Get Better At:** expanding game to marginal hands
- **Profit:** +$35
