Alright, shake it off. After a long day of bug squashing at work, I came in
ready to go for a Tuesday night at the [Encore](http://encoreclub.com). In
the hunt for fish, I'm served only shrimp as Encore's competition could swim
twice as fast as that of Final Table's. Stiffer players that night but all men
are only human, and any human could be leveled. In response, I leveled up my
game, paying extra attention, and was able to obtain accurate reads. Vegeta,
what does the scouter say?

As for the title, I oddly got remarks from several players (including a very
drunk birthday girl) that I looked like the Asian guy from 'The Internship'.
The one with Owen Wilson as a Google intern. I haven't seen it as it's [yet
another shitty comedy](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_internship_2013/).
The actor in question is Tobit Raphael. I admit, there's a hint of resemblance,
especially considering I was a Mountain View intern.

## Encore Club 8pm $1500 Guaranteed - Busted on the Bubble

Everyone was playing pretty tight preflop which put me on alert. This game was
a bit tougher than Final Table's pool where there are frequent limp-calls with
trashy hands. But you can't play poker without thinking you're the best at
the table. So I stepped it up and started classifying players into three
player types.

- Loose-passive: calls a lot, wants to get to showdown
- Aggrodonk: bets a lot, wants everyone to fold
- Weak-tight: folds a lot, wants to only play the nuts

I watched what players did and tipped them towards a certain player type until
proven wrong. There was a player on my right in a hoodie who looked like
someone one of my college CS Operating Systems class. I thought was
loose-passive since he was limp-calling a lot preflop, but I was able to steal
his blinds and cbet him off the flop with extreme ease, changing my perception
of him towards weak-tight.

There was a player on my left with a backwards gray cap and earbuds. I watched
him be aggressive postflop, betting with marginal hands or air. So I adjusted.
I checked with top pair for deception (risking the draw) in hopes the
aggressive small blind would bet. Unfortunately on the turn, the T puts too
many draws out there so I raise. When villain calls, I don't see in getting
any more value on the river with TPNK.

    Hero (BTN): Healthy stack
    Villain (BB): Healthy stack

    Pre Flop: Hero is BTN with K4o
    Hero raises to 3xBB, Villain calls.

    Flop: KQ2r
    Villain checks, Hero checks.

    Turn: T
    Villain bets 3/4 pot, Hero raises 3x bet, Villain calls.

    River: 7
    Villain checks. Hero checks.

    Hero shows K4o
    SB shows ATo

I played pretty perfectly the whole night, making it to the final table in the
40-runner tournament. But I only won 1 flip out of 3 (88 vs QK, AK vs AK vs 33,
A2 vs QK). And when you can't win flips, you lose.

## Session Conclusion

- **Went Well**: punishing the limpers with all-ins from the BB
- **Mistakes**: attempting a loose iso/steal with 2 limpers with J9s on the button
                with a yellow stack. SB woke up with AA. Okay move, but I can choose
                better spots
- **Get Better At**: further develop classifying players
- **Profit**: -$60
