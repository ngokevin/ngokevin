Russell Westbrook, with the OKC Thunder in town, played poker at the
[Encore](http://encoreclub.com) last Monday evening, and I missed it. I went to
play poker Tuesday evening and heard the news, saw the pictures. Westbrook,
injured, had nothing better to do to play a $30 tournament with his $18mil/year
salary. If it weren't for the snowstorm and icy roads, I would've played
against him. Westbrook, 3x NBA all-star, arguably top 10 in the world when
healthy. Also brought in one his girls. Shit. Well, at least I got to bump
fists with the guy who bumped fists with Westbrook. That counts for something,
right? As consolation, I took 4th in a $1500 guaranteed for $230. Yet
to have a losing session continuing from [Poker Session #5](/blog/poker5).

## 6pm $500 Guaranteed - Busted

After a couple weeks of yearning for some cards, I was a bit loose-passive,
incorrectly overlimping due to "pot odds" and leaking chips post-flop with
marginal hands. AA proved to be my demise in this game.

I had AA and raised 3x. Two callers. We all got it all-in on the drawy flop: me
with the overpair, one with top pair, one with a small set. The set held so I
rebought. Same guy later, I ran my KK into AA pre-flop despite my gut yelling
*"he has aces!"*, but I can't fold KK preflop. Busto.

## 8pm $1500 Guaranteed Freezeout - 4th for $230

I went deep in this one. I was chip leader early but dwindled as the blinds
raised. I became average stack then shortstack, but was able to keep my stack
on life support with late position steals. I was able to last until 4th with a
small stack as the smaller shortstacks got eaten up. Once it got four-handed,
it was a boring game of blind steals. I doubled up with AJ over 44 in a blinds
war. I busted trying to steal with K3o on the button when the SB showed with
AA. Good game.

Intersting hand that would have set me up for a possible victory had I won.
I had A4o in the cut-off. I raise, BB calls. Flop goes T54, BB shoves out of
position. He seemed to be a TAG but a tricky one. He pushed me off the previous
two hands, both times showing TT. One of those being a small blind limp-resteal.
I had the feeling I was being outplayed with this shove but my pair felt good.
We were both deep enough to go another street. I ended up folding but maybe I
should have called. If he did have a legitimate hand, he would've have checked
to me, and I would be expected to fire a cbet with my TAG image. Overpairs,
TPTK, sets all had enough room to slowplay. So his range was really polarized
to bluffs and marginal hands.
