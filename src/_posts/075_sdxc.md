With some 64GB SDHC and SDXC cards on Pentax (and possibly other) cameras, you
might get a 'Card Not Formatted' error. It may happen if you take some shots,
plug the SD card into your Mac's card reader, upload the shots, and then unplug
it. I've seen the error on my K30 and K3. Though, it's not an issue with the
camera or the card.

The issue is with unplugging it. With some SD cards on OSX, the SD card has to
be **properly ejected** rather than straight-up unplugging it. Or else it'll be
in some sort of weirdly formatted state. That may be obvious, but I never ran
into issues unplugging cards before.

If you hit the error, you don't have to reformat the card. Simply plug it back
into your machine, eject it, and then everything will have properly torn down
for the card to be usable.
