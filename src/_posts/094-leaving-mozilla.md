Last month, I resigned from Mozilla to work on [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) and
WebVR full-time independently. I've been with Mozilla for the last five years
including my times as an intern and student contractor. I am thankful for the
experiences and growth I've had while at Mozilla.

Nothing will change for A-Frame as an open source project; I will continue to
act as one of the core maintainers, a contributor, and a community member. I am
amped to hone my creative skills and build out what I believe will be the
future of VR. I'll be around as usual on Slack, Twitter, and Stack Overflow.
