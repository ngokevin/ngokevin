I finally took the splurge on an [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com) micro EC2
(Elastic Cloud Compute) instance. Well, it wasn't really a splurge since I
created a new Amazon account to qualify for their one-year free usage tier.

---

The meat of the AWS Free Usage Tier (per month):

- 750 hours of [EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2) Linux Micro Instance Usage (613MB memory) -- the
  whole month
- 30GB of [Elastic Block Storage](http://aws.amazon.com/ebs) -- preallocated "mountable" disk space
- 5GB of [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/ebs)
- 15GB bandwidth out

After the period is over (which I may then create another new account), a Micro
instance is $.020 per hour, and the EBS volumes are $.10 per GB per month. Not
bad at all especially with the recent price drops.
[Linode](http://www.linode.com) was another option, but they had me playing
Goldilocks; they offered a few fixed options that were either not enough or too
much. Amazon on the flip side is pay-as-you-go (and of course a free year).
Perhaps if I used my instance enough, they'll forget about charging me like
they did with my Amazon Prime account that has been good and free since
forever.

I found this to be a good chance to practice my Puppet-eering. A month ago, I
started a Git repository for what meant to be my Puppet manifests, but I never
got around to it. Though with some help from [limed](http://github.com/limed)
and [Playdoh's](http://github.com/mozilla/playdoh) Puppet template, I found a
nice structure for my Puppet files and manifests.

    puppet-ngokevin/
    |-- files
    |   |-- etc
    |   |   |-- apache2
    |   |   |   |-- sites-enabled
    |   |   |       |-- ngokevin.conf
    |   |   |-- vim
    |   |       |-- vimrc
    |   |-- home
    |       |-- bashrc
    |       |-- beetsconfig
    |-- manifests
    |   |-- classes
    |   |   |-- apache2.pp
    |   |   |-- apt.pp
    |   |   |-- bash.pp
    |   |   |-- beets.pp
    |   |   |-- git.pp
    |   |   |-- init.pp
    |   |   |-- ngokevin.pp
    |   |   |-- python.pp
    |   |   |-- subsonic.pp
    |   |   |-- tzdata.pp
    |   |   |-- vim.pp
    |   |   |-- wok.pp
    |   |-- puppet-ngokevin.pp
    |-- pip

I had puppet-ngokevin.pp act as the main manifest, defining parameters and
specifying the order in which classes are applied. And it's smooth sailing from
there: bring in configs, install packages, and set up this site. A successful
Puppet apply is like rolling a d20. After that, I just pointed my domain name
towards the public DNS of my instance, and to the Internet it goes. Next, I need
to get a ~30gB EBS volume to store my music for some Subsonic goodness.

I can finally put to rest my home server that's running under a desk in
Portland. You've done well, friend.
