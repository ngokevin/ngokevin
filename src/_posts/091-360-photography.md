I took the [Ricoh Theta S][theta] all around Hong Kong and Guangzhou for the
holidays. The Ricoh Theta S is a freshly released camera featuring two 180-degree
wide-angle lens that can take 360-degree (equirectangular) photos with a single
exposure or button press, opening up immersive 360-degree photography to the
masses. With most familiar only with flat 2D photography, there is a completely
different workflow to adapt to. Taking the Theta to the streets of Mong
Kok, the most population-dense area and literally the busiest district in the
world, here is what I learned about 360-degree shooting workflow and composition.

## About the Ricoh Theta S

The Ricoh Theta S is the successor to the Ricoh Theta, featuring improvements
across the board just crossing the line of producing usable images. Quick rundown of the
technical specs:

- Two 180-degree fisheye lens (f2)
- 12-megapixel JPEG images (4200x2800)
- Remote connectivity through Wi-Fi with [Android][android] and [iOS][ios] app
- Manual exposure capability (though aperture is fixed at f2)
- Low quality video capability including audio (30fps, upscaled 1920x1080)

It retails at $350. Given the specs, it is an expensive toy for enthusiasts and
early adopters

## Shooting Workflow

Here's what I learned about shooting the camera itself, the physical aspects.

### Remote Shutter is Mandatory

If you handhold the camera, your hand will be very prominent on the lower half
of the 360-degree image. The shutter button is situated underneath the lens,
and there is no way to hide your hand while pressing the button. Unfortunately,
the Theta S does not have a built-in timer capability.

So you must use the Android or iOS apps (linked above) to trigger the shutter
remotely. Install the app, make sure Wi-Fi is not switched off on the camera,
connect to the camera via Wi-Fi (the password is on the bottom of the camera),
and launch the app. You can get a (choppy) live view of the image from the app
as well.

### Tripod is Mandatory

We can shooting remotely, but we need a tripod to hold the camera without
filling up the shot. The Theta *can* stand up by itself, but placing it
on a flat surface will cause the surface to take up a lot of the shot. A
tripod, being a stick, won't take up as much room.

It also allows complete freedom to compose the shot. And it allows us to hold
the camera well above head-level.

I use the [Sony VCT-R100 Tripod][tripod]. It's cheap, lightweight, very
adjustable, and folds up small enough to fit comfortably into a messenger bag.
The pan handle is also useful as a hook to carry the tripod around hands-free.
It's useful for holding above head or placing on the ground.

For a tripod purely for walkaround street photography, I'd also consider
the [Pedco Ultrapod II][tripod2], to be very discreet. Although it is less
versatile than having a tripod that can go to full height.

### Exposure Settings

The Theta has auto, shutter priority, ISO priority, and manual modes.
The aperture is fixed at f2. I switch between shutter speed and ISO priority
depending on the situation.

I mainly shoot ISO priority as it leaves less guesswork. During the day, I
might use about 200-400 ISO just to make sure I get a good shutter speed.
During the night, if the scene had no moving subjects and the camera was on a
stable tripod, I might use ISO 100 to get reduce noise.

Shooting shutter speed priority has bitten me. During the day, I tried to set
1/80 maximum shutter speed and everything was blown out. It's hard to guess
what the minimum shutter speed is so using ISO priority at a low setting
ensures getting that minimum shutter speed.

### Review Images Often

There is less instant feedback when shooting with the Theta since there is no
LCD on the camera. Images must be transferred over Wi-Fi which can take several seconds.
And using the app, it is often too much of a hassle to go to image viewing mode
and then back to shooting mode.

But every once in a while, make sure to chimp on your images to make sure the
exposure settings are correct. Especially when learning to use the camera, it
also helps to check if the composition looks good. It can be surprising with
the wide-angle lens how much it stretches perspective.

### Handling

I found some tips on handling the Theta you will want to know about:

- The Theta goes to sleep after a while. The LED above the shutter will
blink. To wake it up, just press the shutter button.
- The Wi-Fi server on the camera takes a few seconds to boot up. So try to leave
it on while you are shooting or carrying it around. This probably affects
battery life, so bring along some USB battery packs. The Theta might
last only about half a day.
- Just turn off live view in shooting mode. Turning it off reduces
shutter lag, probably saves battery life, and the feed is too choppy and grainy
to be useful anyways.
- The app will also sometimes become unresponsive so you will have to restart it.
- Turning on noise reduction immensely improves image quality.
- Keep the cover on when not in use. It's bound to get scratched or dropped.
- Don't seriously use the video function. 30FPS at less-than-HD quality is
pretty useless for consumption.

### Shooting Alongside a Regular Camera

If you're out on a shoot, you will probably still want to pack your regular
camera alongside the Theta. It will be difficult to wield your regular camera
along with a tripod with the Theta attached.

I *heavily* recommend the [Capture Camera Clip][clip]. The Capture allows you
to holster the camera on a belt or strap. This allows you to carry a camera
hands-free when not in use, without any annoying camera straps. It's secure; I
carry my Pentax K3 on my hip even in tight subways in China without worrying
about getting it swiped.

I also recommend getting a tripod head with a quick-release plate. With the
Theta on a quick release plate, and the Capture being compatible with
quick-release plates, you can switch on the tripod between the Theta and
regular camera rapidly without having to spend time screwing around (pun
intended). I got a quick-release tripod ball head in Mong Kok for $40!

## Composition

Here's what I learned about shooting 360-degree photography overall, the mental aspects.

### What You See is What You Get

Traditionally with wide-angle lenses, the perspective is dramatically
stretched. The foreground will appear very close, and the background will
appear very far. In normal photography, it would be important to get close to
the subject else everything would seem very far.

With 360 photography however since the resulting image will be wrapped around a
sphere rather than displayed on a 2D plane, the perspective will appear like
what you see with your own eyes in real life. Thus, what you see when you take
a shot with the Theta is what you get.

### Height Level for Immersion

Be mindful about how people will view your image. Mostly likely, they will
either be standing up, or sitting down. For optimal immersion, the image would
be shot at the same height level that people would view it. It would feel off
if someone was standing up with a VR headset with the image being taken two
feet off the ground.

Thus for general shots, take at head level for those standing up, or shoulder
level for those sitting down. The height difference between the two shouldn't
be terribly different.

### Sweet Spot

The Theta has a sweet spot of five feet or less. Farther subjects and the
background will have less resolution, giving a reason to bring subjects closer.

#### Keep it Level

Keep the camera as level as possible with the horizon. If it is not straight,
when people view your photo, they may get sick from not being straight in the
photo despite being straight in real life. It would be possible to straigthen
it afterwards, but you save a lot of work getting it right out of the camera.

#### Fill the Frame

Note that it is 360-degree photography. Since you are capturing the whole
environment, you most likely and should not just have one subject. With only
one subject, when people look around in the picture with the headset, they
might have trouble finding the subject as most of the frame will be empty. So
make sure the frame has interesting subjects in every direction.

Alongside the advice of shooting close, 360-degree photography seems to lend
itself better to shooting in tighter scenes. I shot the Theta inside a small
wooden model of an ancient Chinese building, and the image seemed like it was
taken in a full-sized house.

### Limit your Presence

Try to get out of the shot as much as possible. Since it takes an image in
every direction, it can be difficult to hide. The best option is to get out of
the shot entirely. This means setting the tripod down, and hiding behind a bush
or corner while remotely triggering the shot. Unfortunately, this is a bit
awkward in street photography and snapshot situations.

The second best option is to be directly under the camera. Hold the tripod up,
resting it on your shoulder or head, and have the camera be above your head.
This helps that when people view the photo, they would have to view directly
down to see you. And your face would not be visible, only the top of your head,
which is much more discreet.

### Being Discreet

The Theta is so small, and with 360-degree photography being something most
people have no idea about, it is extremely easy to take candid or street shots.

A lot of the time in Hong Kong, I would just walk around holding the tripod
like how a Queen's Guard would hold their rifle, and just take photos using the
app. Using the app really makes it look like you're just checking Facebook or
something, and people never really know you're taking a photo. Or I might just
set the tripod down, lean against the wall like I'm texting, and take a photo.

Well, it does emit an annoying shutter sound that I don't know how to turn off.
But even then, people won't know what that little thing is yet. Not until it
becomes more popular.

## Sharing Images

> You can now try out my project [threeschwifty](https://ngokevin.github.io/threeschwifty) to view and share your 360-degree images online!

In an upcoming post, I'll talk more about how to easily share Theta images
using A-Frame VR. It'd be a few lines of HTML, and then most people can view
the 360 image on their smartphone. They'd be able to move and rotate the phone
to look around the image, and even use something like a [Google
Cardboard][cardboard] holder.
