Call me a mouse-atheist. I love vim; it lets me do everything on the
keyboard. In the time it takes for one to reach for their mouse, highlight a
line to copy and paste, and Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V to copy in Word, I could type "yyp"
in vim.

My whole desktop is vimified: workspace and window management hotkeys,
[Vimperator](https://addons.mozilla.org/en- us/firefox/addon/vimperator/) on
Firefox, [Terminator](http://lifehacker.com/5858676/the-best- terminal-
emulator-for- linux) hotkeys, and vim itself. vim is good for text editing, but
it ain't good at some things that I have simply put up with for years. Two days
ago, I tried out Sublime Text, and today I bought it. Here are five reasons why
[Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com) is just Frosted Flakes great.

##5. vim compatability!

Horray for filler items in list-based posts! Seriously, to replace vim, it must
have vim. Sublime Text comes with **Vintage mode** that has most vim support. It
combines vim's command mode with Sublime Text's. With a few tweaks, I was able
to make it just like vim as far as I could tell, minus some :commands.

To enable it, from your preferences, change

```javascript
"ignored_packages": ["Vintage"]
```

to

```javascript
"ignored_packages": [""]
```

Some tweaks I had to make were having ctrl+f/ctrl+b going pageup/pagedown
instead of search/building, making "u" be undo and not repeat/undo, and setting
ctrl+r to be redo. How did I do that you say? Glance 100 pixels below.

##4. Powerful Keybindings in JSON and Plugins in Python

Set and overwrite keybindings for anything you want. The default settings
openly lists all the keybindings, but you can write stronger ones. It is good
practice to overwrite keybindings and preferences in your local Sublime Text
configs.

It satisfies all of my idiosyncratic keybinding needs such as alt+hjkl to
navigate between panes, typing "jj" in insert mode exits insert mode, or
hitting ctrl+shift+tab throwing in a pdb breakpoint.

What's awesome is that these configs and plugins are **hot-loaded**. Modifying
a config or adding a plugin automatically takes effect on all of your open
buffers.

##3. Package Manager and the More Centralized Community

Install the [PackageControl](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/
installation) plugin with a one-line command into the console, and you can
install all the good Sublime Text plugins within Sublime Text.

My current plugin loadout:

- **PackageControl**: so meta
- **Githubinator**: opens the GitHub page of the current file
- **Git**: git integration into the command palette and console
- **Emmett**: can expand css selectors into HTML syntax
- **Origami**: enhance pane splitting and allows me to set shortcuts to navigate
   between them
- **Theme-Soda**: popular Sublime Text theme
- **SidebarEnhancements**: enhances the sidebar to allow all them file operations
   on right-click
- **SublimeLinter**: all-in-one code linter for popular languages
- **SublimeCodeIntel**: can jump to symbol definitions, give function tooltips,
   and autocomplete code within a whole project
- **LESS**: LESS syntax
- **SCSS**: SCSS syntax

##2. Project Sessions

Close Sublime Text and open it again. All of your buffers and panes will be just
as you left it. For multiple windows, they can be restored if you saved the
project. Granted vim has .swp files, but how many times have I asked vim to
"edit anyways"? And Terminator doesn't remember the pane layouts and what
exactly was on each pane when you closed it.

Now I don't mind my Ubuntu NVIDIA drivers crashing all the time as much.

##1. Ctrl+P - GotoAnything

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/hSApzuX.jpg">

An intelligent autocomplete search that lets you pull up any file within your
project by specifying just a few letters. It is like
[Synapse](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/11/synapse-gnome-do-launcher-app-
review-ubuntu) which autocompletes programs and files on your computer, or
Firefox's **Awesomebar** which can search through content of your browser
history to pull navigation bar suggestions. It just knows what you want.
