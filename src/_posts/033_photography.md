Photography has become largely crowded with much attribution to social networks
developing an insatiable appetite for delicious images. You may spot
photographers in the form of casual snapshotters wanting to share the
not-too-occasional meal, enthusiasts interested in the creative form,
pretentious gear hipsters looking to impress, or professionals somewhat
attracted to having food on the table. Some hate photographs altogether,
feeling they are narcisstic or a reality skewed. But for me, the shutter click
never gets old. I enjoy hobby photography as a culmination of the creative,
technical, and social.

My father has a long background with photography; he used to shoot and film
weddings professionally on the weekends. I grew up exposed around cameras,
every significant moment was captured behind a lens. Now I am starting to grow
an interest. Not that I haven't touched a camera before or didn't already know
about basic textbook composition (rule of thirds, lines, etc). But now
photography has been bumped up to the top of the list of "want to someday
master".

The cool aspect of photography is the entire process of creating a coherent set
of well-composed, well-exposed, and interesting subject photographs that
overall portray a glimpse of a story. As mentioned, I enjoy the creative,
technical, and social aspects photography offers.

- Shooting (the creative/technical)
- Editing and Processing (the technical/creative)
- Sharing (the social/technical)

**Shooting** is the most obvious, pressing dat shutter. We've all done it. This
part allows some creativity in that I select the subject and create the
composition. For me that means travelling, going out to find interesting
places, and applying textbook composition. It is technical in that I analyze
lighting conditions and control for the desired exposure (aperture, shutter
speed, ISO, flash power...the standard sphiel) that captures all the detail I
need for post-processing,

**Editing** is picking the keepers from the lemons, a whole 'nutha process by
itself. Processing, to me, is bringing out the details, exposure, and colors
wanted from an image. It is technical in that I become familiar with a bunch of
sliders and histograms that alter the image. It is creative in the sense that I
select which images to keep to create a coherent set and that I process the
image to highlight what I want emphasized.

**Sharing** is social (yeah, really). The final results are taken and set free
online. Really, I don't care too much if no one bothers to look at them, but
it is satisfaction enough to have them out there. I can sometimes show the
results in person and have it to support a conversation. There is a technical
part for this as I hand-built the [image gallery on my site](/gallery). It is
my [Javascript baby](http://github.com/ngokevin/sriracha) that has grown over
the years which now conveniently feeds off of imgur and flickr APIs.
Photography will allow me to discover domain-specific problems to solve as side
projects that will become useful to other photographers.

Above all, the satisfying feeling is pulling the shutter, taking a glance at
the camera's LCD, and knowing I captured a winner. A photograph that I will
later process thoroughly and then share online, and eventually frame it on the
wall.

More on photography to come.

Shark's Cove, a popular snorkelling and diving location in Oahu, Hawaii. People
were jumping in the crashing waves, yet the photograph captures a feeling of
summertime nostalgia.
