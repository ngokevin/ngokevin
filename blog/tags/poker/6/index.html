              <p>I spent another Saturday playing two 30-man $300 guaranteed turbo freerolls at
the <a href="http://pokerportland.com">Final Table Poker Club</a>. Final Table is
conveniently close to my parent's place (half a mile), similar to how the
<a href="http://www.encoreclub.com/">Encore Poker Club</a> is conveniently close to my
studio (half a mile). Donkaments always readily available. I cashed in both
freerolls with a 1st place finish for $355 and $235. Just played
tight-aggressive in the early-to-middle stages and transitioned to short-stack
and bubble play as the 15-minute blinds quickly ramped up. Continuing the
success from <a href="/blog/poker2">Poker Session #2</a>.</p>

              <p>An all-day Saturday session at the Encore Poker club. I spent the week throwing
back to the old poker days, lurking the 2+2 forums, picking up the Harrington
on Hold'em books, and listening to poker podcasts during my 5-minute commute
and work-outs. My blog now even features its own <a href="/blog/tags/poker">poker
section</a> after bouncing back in forth between migrating it to
<a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> and then standing pat with
<a href="http://wok.mythmon.com">Wok</a>. Wok suits me better with less boilerplate, a
better templating engine, and more support for non-blog pages. Anyways, after a
few monkey-patches with Wok and a custom virutalenv, I'm ready to write some
poker.</p>
<p>I played two MTTs, a 70-man freeroll and a 30-man $500-guaranteed. Made it to
the final tables in both, and cashed in both with a 9th place finish in the
freeroll for $45 and a 2nd place finish in the $500-guaranteed for $265.  Last
session, I cashed in 5th at the $500-guaranteed for $80. So things are rolling well.
Whether I'm running hot, or I'm playing solid, only sample size will tell.</p>

              <p>I went out tonight to Encore Poker Club, a casino style poker room, in NW
Portland to play in a $500-guaranteed, $30 buy-in NLHE multi-table tournament
(MTT). It was my first ever real live poker tournament. There were enough
people to fill three tables, for approximately a pool of 30 players. At each
table were the handsome dealers, with regulars seated around, many donning the
Unabomber look complete with shades and cap. I came in with the mindset to play
just like it was online, no strings attached. I performed alright, considering.
I ended up finishing in <strong>5th</strong> out of about 30, just past the bubble, walking
away with $80 from a prize pool of $1300.</p>

              <p>At <a href="http://lug.oregonstate.edu/blog/bbcx">Beaver Bar Camp X</a>, I gave a talk on
the theory of poker and hold'em strategy. The slides were intended to skim the
iceberg of a professional poker player's mindset. Though I'll skim over what I
talked about here.</p>
<h3 id="my-poker-career-in-a-nutshell">My Poker Career in a Nutshell</h3>
<p>I first started playing online poker seriously on Pokerstars sometime during my
freshman year of college. Attracted by those endless promotions poker rooms
have, my first deposit into Pokerstars was $20. I read books, dove into forums,
did the math, paid for coaching videos, studied the game as if it were for my
computer science degree.</p>
<p>I began to beat the microstakes (2NL 6max) at a hot rate of 20 big blinds per
100 hands over several tens of thousands of hands. I played 4 tables at a time,
and played at least 4 hours a day.  I moved onto 5NL on Full Tilt where I kept
beating the game, then went through a long downswing, though still up. I tried
my hand at a bit of heads-up; it wasn't my thing.  The US Department of Justice
eventually seized Poker Stars and Full Tilt on what was deemed "Black Friday".
That was the end of ...
