              <p>Alright, shake it off. After a long day of bug squashing at work, I came in
ready to go for a Tuesday night at the <a href="http://encoreclub.com">Encore</a>. In
the hunt for fish, I'm served only shrimp as Encore's competition could swim
twice as fast as that of Final Table's. Stiffer players that night but all men
are only human, and any human could be leveled. In response, I leveled up my
game, paying extra attention, and was able to obtain accurate reads. Vegeta,
what does the scouter say?</p>
<p>As for the title, I oddly got remarks from several players (including a very
drunk birthday girl) that I looked like the Asian guy from 'The Internship'.
The one with Owen Wilson as a Google intern. I haven't seen it as it's <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_internship_2013/">yet
another shitty comedy</a>.
The actor in question is Tobit Raphael. I admit, there's a hint of resemblance,
especially considering I was a Mountain View intern.</p>

<a href="http://spiritmountain.com">Spirit Mountain</a>, and the <a href="http://pokerportland.com">Final
Table</a>. A small downswing, making breakeven for the
week. I played poorly at the Encore but just ran card dead and coolered in the
latter two. Used to it though and still eager to play with the games being
really soft. So. much. old. people.</p>

              <p>Russell Westbrook, with the OKC Thunder in town, played poker at the
<a href="http://encoreclub.com">Encore</a> last Monday evening, and I missed it. I went to
play poker Tuesday evening and heard the news, saw the pictures. Westbrook,
injured, had nothing better to do to play a $30 tournament with his $18mil/year
salary. If it weren't for the snowstorm and icy roads, I would've played
against him. Westbrook, 3x NBA all-star, arguably top 10 in the world when
healthy. Also brought in one his girls. Shit. Well, at least I got to bump
fists with the guy who bumped fists with Westbrook. That counts for something,
right? As consolation, I took 4th in a $1500 guaranteed for $230. Yet
to have a losing session continuing from <a href="/blog/poker5">Poker Session #5</a>.</p>

              <p>After playing for 6 hours at the Encore and getting 4 hours of sleep at 5am, I
get up early to catch the bus across town to play at the <a href="http://pokerportland.com">Final
Table</a> on Saturday morning. I placed first (chopping
with second) for <strong>$888</strong> in a 30-man $60/$3000 tourney after busting out in the
morning freeroll. I entertainingly ran over (like with a truck) some familiar
faces from <a href="/blog/poker2">Poker Session #2</a> to gain a massive chip lead heading
to the final table. I later busted out of an ill-advised $50/$2000 deepstack
tourney due to drowsiness and mental incapacitation. This is my biggest cash
thus far and am still reeling Supa Hot Fire from <a href="/blog/poker4">Poker Session #4</a>.</p>
<p>I am polishing the content of these poker posts, balancing poker strategy with
anecdotes as to not sound rambling. Only deeply analyze at max one hand each
session, not spend too much time on big but generic showdowns, and leave the
rest to fun stories. Enjoy!</p>

              <p>I went out with my visiting coworker from MN this Friday night to play some
poker at the <a href="http://www.encoreclub.com">Encore</a>. With $50, we both signed up
for the 100-man $10000 tourney. After several hours we both busted, him right
on the bubble and me around the 40-player mark. Though like any other donk, I
made my way to the $1/$2 cash games at midnight after busting. I had an awesome
time with the loose and free-flowing table talk at late night cash game. There
I took back $290. Although I suffered my first ever live tournament bust (after
5 cashes in a row including 3 high-money finishes), the run-good continues from
