              <p>Another Warriors WCF game, another night at the poker club. I had to wait over
an hour for a seat yet again, but worth. Got a seat in a five-handed game, and
we chopped the blinds five hands in a row. I knew this was going to be an
extremely tight table, especially with everyone distracted with the game and
autopiloting. Heck, it took everyone ten seconds every hand to look at their
cards since their attention was to the screens. So I let loose and took down
the blinds ($7) nearly every hand. I never lost a pot I was involved in, and
eventually walked away <strong>+$180</strong> after less than an hour. And Warriors won,
good night.</p>

              <p>Achievement unlocked! $5000 profit logged since playing live poker. A grindy
<strong>+$130</strong> session put me over the line as I controlled a four-handed table.
Now I look at getting to $10K, and hopefully reaching there within half a year.
I'm playing nightly after work, and it's healthy; it keeps me from burning out,
and it gives me a reason to code something I need. So here comes another
session of blogging. The only reason why I'm writing this post now and not
playing is there weren't enough runners at 10pm at the club tonight.</p>
<p>Let me take a second to do a little dance: I've played 95 poker sessions (a
tournament or cash game sitting), made $15K revenue with $10K investment,
totaling out to $5K.</p>

              <p>Return of the <a href="http://petes881club.com/">Pete's 881 Club</a>. The poker addiction
is Sidious. Last Friday after a night at Off the Grid, I went down <strong>-$110</strong> in
a 2/5NL cash game, a case of card-dead, but I lost the minimum, and it could
have gone worse. Then on Sunday I played a deepstack tourney and dropped my
<strong>-$120</strong> buy-in, I was playing close-to-perfect but got sucked out on after
someone tried a stop-and-go bluff. Tonight, I went up a <strong>+$500</strong> buy-in in
about an hour in the 2/5NL cash game. I admit I ran a little hot, but I'll take
it as a reward for enduring the cold. And as usual, I always blog after a good
night while ignoring the bad ones.</p>
<p>I walked into Pete's, an older Vietnamese regular yelled "ah, you go to school,
then come here?" as I had my backpack. I had brought my laptop to work while I
was waiting for a seat. The waitress also IDed me. #curryface.</p>

              <p>Back-to-back at <a href="http://petes881club.com/">Pete's 881 Club</a>, looking to play
more solid than the previous night. Called ahead and was told the place was
full, so I watched some Mad Men to wait it out and headed in at 11PM. Literally
takes less than a minute to get there. Got a seat, played for about 45 minutes,
ended up <strong>+$280</strong> in the green.</p>
<p>Again got some questions since I was a new face. Older Asian guy on my right
notices, asks me about my ethnicity, and found we share the grand Vietnamese
heritage. Exchange a few words in Vietnamese before I said "oh and English only
at the table!", to which the dealer jokingly thanked me.</p>

              <p>Happened to move in right next to a poker room in San Rafael, CA, <a href="http://petes881club.com/">Pete's 881
Club</a> I'd been having the urge to reboot the poker. I
went to check it out. And it's solid; there's no door fee, no rake, tight ship,
and they run daily cash games until 2AM. The smallest game is 2/5NL ($500
buy-in). I haven't had much cash game experience and only played a few sessions
of 1/2NL ($200 buy-in), but took a shot. Shook off the rust and headed out.
30-second drive, and a couple of hours later, I ended the session +$165.</p>
