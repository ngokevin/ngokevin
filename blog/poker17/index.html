  <h1>Poker Session #18 - Jetlagged but Min-Waged</h1>
  <p>2 Apr 2014</p>

  <p>Back from an overnight flight from AK with a healthy dose of lack-of-sleep with
a drop of jetlag. Against better judgement, I headed to <a href="http://pokerportland.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Final
Table</a> to play the 11am freeroll. It was one of the
first times I played with my hoodie up, but it wasn’t to hide my poker face; it
was to create a happy place where I could close my eyes. I cashed 5th out of 30
for $65. Interestingly, the owner of the club jumped in with a $200 bounty,
stating his earnings would go to the dealers.</p>

into marginal situations. Though this made myself even more tired from the
boredom of waiting for good hands in good positions, but I kept patience.
People verbally caught on how tight I was playing but I wasn’t able to take
advantage of that table image, not finding good spots to steal.</p>
<p>The $200 bounty on the owner caused a lot of action, action that you might find
playing the <a href="https://www.caesarscasino.com/en/all-games" ref="nofollow" target="_blank" rel="external">best online casino games</a>.</p>
<p>Busted with 77 vs 88 after 4 hours of play and my girlfriend waiting
restlessly.  $35 profit / 4hrs = $8.75/hr, good for minimum wage. Time to go
