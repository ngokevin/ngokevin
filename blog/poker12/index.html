  <h1>Poker Session #13 - Suck Out</h1>
  <p>26 Feb 2014</p>

  <p>Played at the Encore after work. The 6pm $500 guaranteed. I like to play 30-man
SNGs but unfortunately only 14 showed up that night.  Single table SNGs aren’t
my strong suit as only 3 places pay out, and bubble play becomes tighter. I
love aggressive bubble play, but there’s little place for that here. Towards
the end, I got it in two times in a row a 9:1 favorite and got sucked out on
both times. 7th place sadness.</p>
<p>Some older guy asked whether or not I dyed my hair and joked he would like to
change to my style.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="session-conclusions"><a href="#session-conclusions" class="headerlink" title="Session Conclusions"></a>Session Conclusions</h2><p>AA vs 58o on a 234 board, AQ vs QT preflop are no good.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Went Well:</strong> thinking about good flops to check back (KQ on a AKx board)</li>
<li><strong>Mistakes:</strong> got a bit spewy after the suck outs and tried to punish + bluff OOP too large</li>
<li><strong>Get Better At</strong>: less results-oriented thinking, thicker skin</li>
<li><strong>Profit</strong>: -$60</li>
</ul>
