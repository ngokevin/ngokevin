  <meta property="og:description" content="T-Mobile offers an extremely competitive monthly no-contract plan: $30 for 5GB of 4G/LTE data, 100min. talk, and unlimited text. With hotspot, and after 5GB, data is rate-limited to 2G speeds. It&#39;s such a great deal, T-Mobile is keeping it hush, pushing it to the fine-print, and ordering hits on anyone shouting it from the streets. This plan is an online-exclusive and requires careful steps to acquire. But worth. Compare it to T-Mobile&#39;s more loudly-advertised prepaid plans: $30 for 30MB data and 1500min. talk/text. $60 for 2.5GB data and unlimited talk/text. $70 for unlimited data, unlimited talk/text, and no hotspot. And compare it to AT&amp;T&#39;s plans, which are all theft on the magnitude of Ocean&#39;s Eleven: $25 for 250min. talk, unlimited text, and 0MB + $5/50MB data. $40 for 500min. talk, unlimited text. 200MB + $5/50MB. $60 for unlimited talk/text and 2GB + $10/1GB data. If you&#39;re one to chatter on the phone for hours, you can stop reading here, as the $30 plan only offers 100 minutes of text (though if you&#39;re using AT&amp;T, I&#39;d consider the switch). But if you got tight lips and a large mouth for data, this plan is minty. However, if you&#39;re an existing T-Mobile customer, you can&#39;t just simply switch to this plan. And if you&#39;re an AT&amp;T or other customer, you can&#39;t just simply activate a new plan in-store. Here are the conditions: New activations only. Online only. New activations only so if you&#39;re already a T-Mobile customer, you may have to get a new number. Other customers can port their number into T-Mobile when activating online. T-Mobile claims that this plan is a Walmart exclusive and that you must buy a T-Mobile Walmart phone kit, however, that&#39;s a lie. They state this on their website, they stated me this at Walmart, and they stated me this when talking to T-Mobile customer representatives on the phone/chat. T-Mobile stores themselves will usually &#39;fess up though. Here are the steps to get the plan. Get a T-Mobile Phone You will need a T-Mobile phone to activate the plan online, or an IMEI serial number of a T-Mobile phone. If you are switching to T-Mobile, it might be safe to say you will buy a T-Mobile phone. If you are already on T-Mobile, well, that&#39;s moot. If you are trying to use it on a non-T-Mobile unlocked phone, you can buy a cheap phone just for the number. The plan will be worth buying a throwaway phone. For me, I had an iPhone 5 during the summer (I found my unlocked AT&amp;T Galaxy S2 wasn&#39;t capable of 3G/4G data on T-Mobile, and did not like the HTC One/Galaxy S4/Nexus 4). Buy a T-Mobile SIM Card Activation Kit Online T-Mobile stores mostly don&#39;t sell these kits. But they are acquired easily online, that includes straight from T-Mobile&#39;s website. T-Mobile often runs a deal that comes up about once a month where they give these kits away for free. They are regularly $10. Here are links to where you can order T-Mobile SIM activation kits: T-Mobile Full-Size SIM Card Activation Kit T-Mobile Micro SIM Card Activation Kit T-Mobile Nano (iPhone 5+) SIM Card Activiation Kit Activate Online Once you receive your kit, you should now have three necessary things to activate the new plan: T-Mobile phone IMEI serial number (comes on phone box) SIM card number (comes with kit) Activation Code (comes with kit) Then head over to T-Mobile to activate your SIM card on a prepaid phone plan. Follow the steps, and yes, I know T-Mobile&#39;s web forms are totally jank, to activate. If you are considering porting your phone number from another service, there will be an option to do so. Existing T-Mobile customers should get an error if trying to port. I tried calling T-Mobile to port my number manually, but what they did was activate my new SIM card on my existing line and deactivated my old one, which was not what I wanted. I had to buy another activation kit. Choose Your Plan Online (For the Win) Once you get to this portion, the $30 plan should be an option. It should say 100mins of talk, 5GB of data, unlimited text, and new activations only. We&#39;ve gotten this far, click that victory radio button, and the plan should now be yours. Pay the $30 to fill the account (I used a T-Mobile $30 refill card), set up auto-pay if you wish. The plan has been up for almost a couple years, but do it now before too many people notice and they rescind the plan! Enjoy your five gee-bees per month for cheeps!"/>
