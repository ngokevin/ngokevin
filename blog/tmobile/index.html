  <h1>Attaining the Clandestine T-Mobile $30 5GB Plan</h1>
  <p>20 Nov 2013</p>

  
    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/nzpcdqI.png">
  

  <p>T-Mobile offers an extremely competitive monthly no-contract plan:
<strong>$30 for 5GB of 4G/LTE data, 100min. talk, and unlimited text</strong>. With hotspot,
and after 5GB, data is rate-limited to 2G speeds. It’s such a great deal,
T-Mobile is keeping it hush, pushing it to the fine-print, and ordering hits on
anyone shouting it from the streets. This plan is an online-exclusive and
requires careful steps to acquire. But worth.</p>
<hr>
<p>Compare it to T-Mobile’s more loudly-advertised prepaid plans:</p>
<ul>
<li>$30 for 30MB data and 1500min. talk/text.</li>
<li>$60 for 2.5GB data and unlimited talk/text.</li>
<li>$70 for unlimited data, unlimited talk/text, and no hotspot.</li>
</ul>
<p>And compare it to AT&amp;T’s plans, which are all theft on the magnitude of Ocean’s Eleven:</p>
<ul>
<li>$25 for 250min. talk, unlimited text, and 0MB + $5/50MB data.</li>
<li>$40 for 500min. talk, unlimited text. 200MB + $5/50MB.</li>
<li>$60 for unlimited talk/text and 2GB + $10/1GB data.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re one to chatter on the phone for hours, you can stop reading here, as
the $30 plan only offers 100 minutes of text (though if you’re using AT&amp;T, I’d
consider the switch).</p>
<p>But if you got tight lips and a large mouth for data, this plan is minty. However,
if you’re an existing T-Mobile customer, you can’t just simply switch to this
plan. And if you’re an AT&amp;T or other customer, you can’t just simply activate a
new plan in-store. Here are the conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>New activations only.</li>
<li>Online only.</li>
</ul>
<p>New activations only so if you’re already a T-Mobile customer, you may have to
get a new number. Other customers can port their number into T-Mobile when
activating online.</p>
<p>T-Mobile claims that this plan is a Walmart exclusive and that you must buy a
T-Mobile Walmart phone kit, however, that’s a lie. They state this on their
website, they stated me this at Walmart, and they stated me this when talking
to T-Mobile customer representatives on the phone/chat. T-Mobile stores
themselves will usually ‘fess up though. Here are the steps to get the plan.</p>
<p>##Get a T-Mobile Phone</p>
<p>You will need a T-Mobile phone to activate the plan online, or an IMEI serial
number of a T-Mobile phone. If you are switching to T-Mobile, it might be
safe to say you will buy a T-Mobile phone. If you are already on T-Mobile, well,
that’s moot. If you are trying to use it on a non-T-Mobile unlocked phone, you
can buy a cheap phone just for the number. The plan will be worth buying a
throwaway phone. For me, I had an iPhone 5 during the summer (I found
my unlocked AT&amp;T Galaxy S2 wasn’t capable of 3G/4G data on T-Mobile, and did
not like the HTC One/Galaxy S4/Nexus 4).</p>
<p>##Buy a T-Mobile SIM Card Activation Kit Online</p>
<p>T-Mobile stores mostly don’t sell these kits. But they are acquired easily
online, that includes straight from T-Mobile’s website. T-Mobile often runs a
deal that comes up about once a month where they <a href="http://slickdeals.net/permadeal/106422/t-mobile---t-mobile-prepaid-phone-sim-card-activation-kit-full-micro-or-nano-size" target="_blank" rel="external">give these kits
away</a>
<strong>for free</strong>. They are regularly $10. Here are links to where you can order
T-Mobile SIM activation kits:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/prepaid-phone/T-Mobile-Prepaid-SIM-Activation-Kit-No-Annual-Contract?AID=11456737&amp;PID=1225267" target="_blank" rel="external">T-Mobile Full-Size SIM Card Activation Kit</a></li>
<li><a href="http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/prepaid-phone/T-Mobile-Micro-SIM-Card-Activation-Kit-No-Annual-Contract?AID=11456737&amp;PID=1225267" target="_blank" rel="external">T-Mobile Micro SIM Card Activation Kit</a></li>
<li><a href="http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/prepaid-phone/T-Mobile-Nano-SIM-Card-Prepaid?AID=11456737&amp;PID=1225267" target="_blank" rel="external">T-Mobile Nano (iPhone 5+) SIM Card Activiation Kit</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="activate-online"><a href="#activate-online" class="headerlink" title="Activate Online"></a>Activate Online</h2><p>Once you receive your kit, you should now have three necessary things to
activate the new plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>T-Mobile phone IMEI serial number (comes on phone box)</li>
<li>SIM card number (comes with kit)</li>
<li>Activation Code (comes with kit)</li>
</ul>
<p>Then head over to
<a href="http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/prepaid-activate" target="_blank" rel="external">T-Mobile</a> to activate
your SIM card on a prepaid phone plan. Follow the steps, and yes, I know
T-Mobile’s web forms are totally jank, to activate. If you are considering
porting your phone number from another service, there will be an option to do
so.</p>
<p>Existing T-Mobile customers should get an error if trying to port. I tried
calling T-Mobile to port my number manually, but what they did was activate my
new SIM card on my existing line and deactivated my old one, which was not what
I wanted. I had to buy another activation kit.</p>
<p>##Choose Your Plan Online (For the Win)</p>
<p>Once you get to this portion, the $30 plan should be an option. It should say
100mins of talk, 5GB of data, unlimited text, and <em>new activations only</em>. We’ve
gotten this far, click that victory radio button, and the plan should now be
yours. Pay the $30 to fill the account (I used a T-Mobile $30 refill card),
set up auto-pay if you wish.</p>
<p>The plan has been up for almost a couple years, but do it now before too many
people notice and they rescind the plan! Enjoy your five gee-bees per month
for cheeps!</p>
