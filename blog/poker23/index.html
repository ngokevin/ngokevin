  <p>Back-to-back at <a href="http://petes881club.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Pete’s 881 Club</a>, looking to play
more solid than the previous night. Called ahead and was told the place was
full, so I watched some Mad Men to wait it out and headed in at 11PM. Literally
takes less than a minute to get there. Got a seat, played for about 45 minutes,
ended up <strong>+$280</strong> in the green.</p>
<p>Again got some questions since I was a new face. Older Asian guy on my right
notices, asks me about my ethnicity, and found we share the grand Vietnamese
heritage. Exchange a few words in Vietnamese before I said “oh and English only
at the table!”, to which the dealer jokingly thanked me.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="observe-and-execute"><a href="#observe-and-execute" class="headerlink" title="Observe and Execute"></a>Observe and Execute</h2><p>Spent a couple of hands trying to gain some reads. A fit-and-fold shortstack on
my left, seems a bit red-faced, letting loose some steam after work. Though I
guess I was letting loose as well. Third guy on my left, really aggressive and
spewing chips, also red-faced, call him <strong>Don Draper</strong> for the spitting image.
Labor worker on my right. Alright, everyone downloaded.</p>
<p>I pick up <strong>JQo</strong> in the small blind ahead of four limpers (calling preflop
without raising). I push it up to 5x for $25. Everyone called. Not surprised,
it’s a loose game, I should probably tighten up out-of-position. But no need,
I flop <strong>trips</strong>! I could slowplay this, but I think I can induce Don Draper
with a weak looking cbet. I bet $20, and he calls. Turns come an Ace.</p>
<p>Then I induce harder. Induce, not seduce, by the way. I guess I’m seducing his
chips. Wait, that sounds wrong too. Crap. Well, I just check to make it seem
like I’m shutting down. Bait taken and trap set, he bets out $100! I put him
on a pretty pure bluff, I’ve seen him shove with ace-high. I just call.</p>
<p>I check in the dark <strong>like a baller</strong>, making it seem like I’m on a marginal
hand. He bets out $120. I probably should have raised, maybe get a smaller J
or an Ace to call. Hopefully, he had a bluff because I just called.</p>
<h2 id="lost-value-due-to-an-angle"><a href="#lost-value-due-to-an-angle" class="headerlink" title="Lost Value due to an Angle"></a>Lost Value due to an Angle</h2><p>Another hand with Don Draper. I have AQ suited in the BB. Don puts in his
entire stack across the line, but then takes it back, leaving only $5. That’s
a big no-no in poker, chips across the line are in play. But he’s off the hook
as none of the players called it on him. I should have in hindsight, but I’ve
seen people pull off that angleshoot (cheap moves exploiting loopholes in
poker) with Aces, so I was immediately suspicious. I just check.</p>
<p>I flop trips again, but I couldn’t induce any action. I make a full house by
the river, but I didn’t get any value. Took down a small pot. So that move
probably made me lose out on about $40.</p>
<h2 id="no-pictures-at-the-table"><a href="#no-pictures-at-the-table" class="headerlink" title="No Pictures at the Table"></a>No Pictures at the Table</h2><p>Drunk guy gets scolded for taking a picture of the table. Big no-no, taking
pictures of other people at the table or the table itself. Though the dealer
reassured it was okay to take a quick snap of your chipstack if you’re having a
good night.</p>
<p>Good night.</p>
