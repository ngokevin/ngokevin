  <h1>Poker Session #17 - When Winning $790 is Disappointing</h1>
  <p>16 Mar 2014</p>

  <p><strong>$80,000</strong> tournament, first place paid $20K, 15 people left. I had a healthy
stack with at least a guaranteed $790 payout after I had put $225 in. With AA,
I lose an 80/20 (80% chance to win) all-in after the flop to bust out right
before the substantial pay bumps. <em>Shock, denial, anger, bargaining,
depression, and then acceptance</em>. After playing solid for 10 hours, I do the
long skate home, can’t help but thinking of the thousands I was practically
guaranteed. Just to rub it in, the club posted on FB the picture of the guy
that sucked out on me right after I busted pretty saying <em>“look how many chips
he has!!!”</em>.</p>

<h2 id="final-table-80k-15th-place-for-790"><a href="#final-table-80k-15th-place-for-790" class="headerlink" title="Final Table $80K - 15th Place for $790"></a>Final Table $80K - 15th Place for $790</h2><p>The club was packed at 300 people. Hot, humid, bustling. I had reserved my spot
two weeks prior for a $150 buy-in. I saw all the familiar faces of the Portland
poker scene, this was the place to be. Everyone was dreaming about the $20K 1st
place prize, but for most people they were already drawing dead. But I didn’t
plan on it being me.</p>
<p>I played a bit loose the first hour, making a couple of mistakes, but able to
aggressively gain back chips. I had good reads on a LAG and was able to get in
a couple of good squeezes and 3bets. And there was a calling station fish on my
right. There was a TAG wearing Beats (by Dre) on my left but we didn’t have too
much trouble with each other. Stayed at that table for 5 hours. With breaks in
between, I had some Burger King and some bottled coffee from the mini-mart next
door.</p>
<p>Midway into the tournament, like Katniss, I caught fire. I was dealt QQ five
times with a couple hours, getting it all in preflop everytime. They held every
time to give me the chip lead with 70 people left.</p>
<p>In the last three tables, I cooled down and showed down some second-best hands,
but was able to still steal aggressively (preflop raise/cbet, resteals, button
min-raises, open all-ins). I really enjoyed opening pots preflop for the
min-raise late tournament. It chases bad hands out that otherwise have equity
,gets some worse hands to call, lets me fold to 3bets, all while taking
initiative.</p>
<p>Then came the biggest suckout of my life. $790 is chump change compared to what
my equity was after doubling up and getting to the final table where I can
really do some damage. Oh well, <strong>deal with it</strong>.</p>

  Why yes, yes I do.
</span></div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Went Well:</strong> played solid for 10 hours, good late tournament play</li>
<li><strong>Mistakes:</strong> calling bets from a passive player early stage, made a bad value bet
on the river against someone who was pretty much softplaying me and trying to save
me chips because we were both Viet</li>
<li><strong>Get Better At:</strong> I hate to say it, but get better at winning 80/20s</li>
<li><strong>Profit:</strong> +$565</li>
</ul>
