  <h1>Poker Session #29 - After Hiatus</h1>

  <p>A few months back, I wrote about planning on <a href="/blog/poker19">building a poker app for live
tournament poker players</a>. I started playing poker a lot in the
summer, nearly every day after work (<a href="/blog/feed">sprinting on the Marketplace
Feed</a>). I stopped writing about poker since I settled into a
grind. For those months, I was in the top three at my local poker club for
tournament points. I spent the time after work and tournaments to build out my
poker app. As a web developer with an iPhone, I wanted to build my app with
HTML5 but be able to dogfeed it. So I built the app as a hybrid mobile app
using <a href="http://ionicframework.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Ionic Framework</a>. Using this, I then went to
London to facilitate a session on <a href="/blog/mozfest">building hybrid mobile apps at Mozilla
Festival 2014</a>. Afterwards though, I focused heavily on work and
not doing much else. I broke the spell today, however, and went out to play a
tournament after nearly a month in hiatus. placing <strong>first in a $1K guarantee
tournament for $255</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-poker-app"><a href="#the-poker-app" class="headerlink" title="The Poker App"></a>The Poker App</h2><p>The app works great! You can <em>currently</em> demo it at
<a href="https://shuvit.ngokevin.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Shuvit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ngokevin/shuvit" target="_blank" rel="external">view the
source</a> on Github. It’s not live on any app
stores yet, however I’m able to install it as a web app in Safari to my iOS
homescreen.  Here’s what it currently features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stat tracking</li>
<li>Session logging</li>
<li>Late tournament push-fold bot</li>
<li>Villain journal</li>
<li>Dropbox integration</li>
</ul>
<p>And some screen captures:</p>

Running on a non-24-hour sleep cycle, where my sleep schedule
shifts forward two hours every day, I had just finished working from 8pm to
9am. I live in sort of an isolated time chamber with no obligations to the
clock. At home, I don’t find much else to do besides work. With my girlfriend
in another state, I balance free time between photography, poker, and a little
bit of the piano. Anyways, I was on total auto-pilot, sort of in a carefree
daze. But it was enough to take it home. I played patiently at the start,
and aggressive small-ball towards the end.</p>
<p>The final four was tougher than usual. One of the players on my right I knew
was pretty smart, but he had been giving me a ton of respect the whole game,
mentioning he doesn’t know why he keeps folding to me. Though by now, I think
against him, I seem like a loose caller in all-in situations. The player on
my left I was involved in a lot of blind vs. blind situations, we got into
a bit of a verbal metagame.</p>
<p>The funniest hands were against a guy who’s pretty funny and is one of the
regulars at the club. There was a hand where I raised AKs UTG, with several
callers, and he’s in the SB. The flop comes wet and low, totally missing me, so
I check back. Eventually, another guy hits runner-runner flush, and he gets
<em>tilted</em> that I didn’t cbet and allowed the flush to get there. He smashed
the flop and wanted to check-raise what he thought was going to be an UTG
cbet. So despite being out of the hand, he steams at me and walks out of the</p>
<p>Though he got me back when I min-raised his BB, and we went to the flop. He
checked dark and said <em>bring me a Jack!</em>. Well, that threw me off when I Jack
came, I didn’t cbet my pocket pair and just checked. He bet the turn and I
folded. And he showed Q-high.</p>
<p>There was a hand in the BvB where I limp, to mix it up, from the SB with Q9. He
calls. The flop comes Q6x. I bet, he raises, I call. I hit two-pair on the turn
and we check through.  The river comes another 6, putting a flush on the board.
I thought a 6 was likely in his range, and I wanted to keep his bluffing range
in play. So I checked. He became suspicious, “<em>I can’t believe you didn’t bet
that…”</em>. He checks back and shows trips. I remark, <em>“well, I can’t believe you
didn’t bet THAT!”</em>. The player to my right tells both of us, <em>“I can’t
believe neither of you bet!”</em>. I saved some chips that hand.</p>
<p>Once we got to the push/fold stage. We elected to flatten the structure, giving
everyone $220 even and play winner-take-all for the remaining $90. With
four players, it became a silly structure at 220/220/220/310, so we just
chopped after a few hands. The floor director jokingly scoffed, <em>“after all
that work I didn’t to change the structure…”</em>, as he was paying us out.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>It’s nice to shake off the rust with a win. After hiatuses like these, after
the first tournament, I start to pick up and come back in full force. My many
hobbies become active one-at-a-time in phases, and baby, it’s poker season.
Next week will be the Mozilla all-hands in Portland, where everyone flies to
Portland to hang out all week. Planning on playing with some coworkers at the
Encore. Good times.</p>
