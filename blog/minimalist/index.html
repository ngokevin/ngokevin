  <meta property="og:description" content="And the hacking goes on. The main event for today, Mozilla HTML 5 Webapps hackathon. The prize, glory and fame...and smartphones. I teamed up with Sawyer Hollenshead, another Mozilla intern, to create Minimalist, a list-building app for noting down categorized thoughts such as &#39;places I want to visit&#39; or &#39;things I want to accomplish this year&#39;. Spoilers, we took home smartphones. In this edition of the ngokevin Bi-weekly, I&#39;ll describe how the hack day was, what it means for an app to be open, and some cool HTML 5 features we used. Hack Day Got up at early 8am. That was the second earliest time I&#39;ve woken up thus far this summer. We got to the office for some bagels/cream cheese and orange juice. No time to lose, we started hacking. We basically split up with him taking mostly the frontend and me the backend. I got off to a quick start, but as expected I ran into a pitfall (trying to return from a jQuery .each loop). After spending half an hour on that, I began to rush myself. I wasn&#39;t really thinking about my code, I was kinda just banging on my keyboard. Lunch time. Burritos and coffee. Now my mind was really mush. I couldn&#39;t make out my rushed code and kept hacking on it to make it even more disgusting. It got bad enough that I wasn&#39;t making too much progress in the last two hours. As time ticked down, I rushed even faster, but that didn&#39;t do too much good. Before I knew it, time&#39;s up. Damn, wish I had another hour. Demo the apps. We rolled the dice on demoing app cache, expecting it to fail, which it did. Ah, maybe we should&#39;ve rehearsed this. Oh well, presentation went fairly well. Other apps featured an IRC bouncer/web client, a remake of Bugzilla, and an Instagram clone using shaders and a custom-patched Firefox. Up to the judges. Minimalist was good for 2nd behind Snappy, an Instagram clone. Ah, if I only I hadn&#39;t cracked under the time. Oh well, constellation prize (which was also the grand prize), Samsung Galaxy S2s with Firefox OS installed. Later on I went home and regutted out my ugly code and made Minimalist a thing of beauty. After a long day, I&#39;m proud of the results. See it in the Mozilla Marketplace in the future. Check it out! Open Web Apps The open web is a beautiful mission, and it&#39;s difficult to describe. How I envision an open web is a web that is owned by nobody, but innovated by everybody. An open web is built upon web standards (HTML 5, CSS3, Javascript) and not proprietary locked-down drivel. It&#39;s created with common languages that every developer can understand. There are no coporations imposing their proprietary &#39;you are mine&#39; platforms in an attempt to lock in developers into their markets. If developers are slowed down and locked away, then less cool stuff gets to the users, and thus the web would begin to suck. Current app markets (iOS Store, Google Play) kinda suck. They house a lot of great apps, and they seem alright, but we&#39;ve gotten complacent. Objective-C and Java are the power languages in the app market. It&#39;s a cup of tea to some people, but they&#39;re clunky by today&#39;s standards. Web standard languages are a much lower barrier of entry to development. You need to grab their respective SDKs to develop on them, or even pay for them in Apple&#39;s case. Developers are locked into either Apple or Google. It&#39;s one or the other, you only get to develop for a subset of users. With the web though, it&#39;s something most everyone can access. Develop on the web, have it run on everything. But wait, weren&#39;t Apple&#39;s first iPhone apps built on top of the web? Yes, but that was back when Javascript was very slow. The web was not ready then, but the web is ready now. People are starting to get bored of native applications. It&#39;s a pretty mundane thing. Open web apps are the future, and it&#39;s a bit of a self-pat, but Mozilla is paving this road to move the web forward. There is only one mission, make the Internet better for everyone. HTML 5 Features Part of the limelight of the open web is the browser-adoption of HTML 5 standards. With it being &#34;open web app hack day&#34;, we employed several cool HTML 5 features to Minimalist. A requirement for Minimalist was that it had to work completely offline. It should be able to add items to a list and have it still be there upon refresh. It should also remember which list it was looking at last. Refreshing the page should not lose state. To do so, we employed HTML5&#39;s local storage and app cache features. Local Storage It&#39;s like your browser has its own cute little database. Local storage is a client-side key-value store that web apps can access. We can store items into local storage and pull them back out later without the need for fetching data from some server on the Internet. It&#39;s ridiculously easy to access, with Javascript through the window.localStorage object. It mostly acts like a key-value store, except it stores everything as a string so remember to type-cast your values correctly. JSON.parse and JSON.stringify really comes in handy here. App Cache Configuring the app cache tells the client to download everything (usually) and cache it. When the client opens the app again, instead of fetching it from your server, it&#39;ll just load the pages and elements from its cache. The user can visit the app&#39;s URL in the browser offline, and it will still load off its cache. To set up the app cache, first create a cache.manifest file in your apps&#39;s root. CACHE # v1 index.html NETWORK jquery.js http://ajax.jquery/jquery.js This will tell the browser to cache index.html and to get jquery from the Internet if possible. The browser will check for every time the cache manifest file is changed (e.g. bump up v1 to v2), and re-pull resources if necessary. Now we don&#39;t want to cache the manifest file itself since the browser will be stuck with an old version of the app for a while, so we can drop an .htaccess file to specify the correct content type and tell apache not to cache it. AddType text/cache-manifest .manifest &lt;Files .cache.manifest&gt; ExpiresActive On ExpiresDefault &#34;access&#34; &lt;/Files&gt; Hm, that should be good. If done correctly, most browsers will display a prompt whether it should store local data from the app. What&#39;s Next It&#39;s 5am now, that coffee from noon had its way with me. Standard Marketplace hacking (proud of where it&#39;s gotten). Some polishing of DrawNothing and Minimalist. 24h Yahoo Hackathon next week! Let&#39;s go for a third hackathon finish, yeah? Mozilla kayaking day in the bay right afterwards."/>
