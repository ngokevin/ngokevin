  <h1>Poker Sessions #19 to #27 - Downswing</h1>

  <p>Since returning from a three-week personal/work/family trip in Florida, things
have not gone too hot. Busted out of a $5K (-$80), out of a freeroll (-$60),
a $3K (-$90), a couple of small $300s (-$90), a couple of $1500s (-$100), and
a couple more $5Ks (-$160). That totals for a -$480 dip. Though I try not to be
results-oriented.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first couple of tournaments were rust. I chalk the rest up to “that’s
tournament poker”. MTTs are naturally swingy, despite playing pretty solid.
Most bust outs were failed steals in the higher all-in-or-fold  blind levels,
a couple were suckouts. But I won’t recite every bust-out hand.</p>
<p>Though I have been doing pretty solid live, I have been getting undisciplined
in my online poker play. It’s time to hit the books and tighten up.
Harrington has a solid guide for preflop play that I need to freshen up upon.</p>
<p>After doing some bookkeeping, my poker bankroll after after 27 sessions is
<strong>+$3272</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="sessions-conclusions"><a href="#sessions-conclusions" class="headerlink" title="Sessions Conclusions"></a>Sessions Conclusions</h2><ul>
<li><strong>Went Well:</strong> improving on hand-reading, taking less marginal lines, super patience</li>
<li><strong>Mistakes:</strong> some loose push-fold play, thinking limpers always have marginal hands</li>
<li><strong>Get Better At</strong>: studying on late push-fold play, whether it needs to tighten up</li>
<li><strong>Profit</strong>: -$480</li>
</ul>
