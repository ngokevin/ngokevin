  <h1>EV Calculation for JJ Facing a 3bet Shove</h1>
  <p>24 Aug 2014</p>

  

  <p>It’s the final table of the tournament. There are 8 players left. I have an
above average size stack about 8 times the the size of the pot (M=8). I’m
in early position, UTG+1, with JJ. I raise ~2.2x. It folds around to the BB.
The BB is the chipleader, a southern guy who isn’t much of a thinker. I just
saw him 3bet shove over a shortstack with 99, and raise/call with KQo. He 3bet
shoves, putting me all in.</p>
<p>After a few seconds of thinking, I called. I was getting <strong>2.2:1 odds on my
call</strong> (call 34k to win 71k), and guessed that it was good. I was willing to
take the variance hit in order to secure a chip lead to take down the
tournament. Trying to learn how to risk a probable cash-out to make a go for
first place (reduce the ITM% to increase the ROI%). I said that I guessed 2.2:1
odds was good against his shoving range, so let’s do the math and see if that
checks out.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="tallying-up-combos"><a href="#tallying-up-combos" class="headerlink" title="Tallying up Combos"></a>Tallying up Combos</h2><p>First, we ask. What range is he shoving? Not much. I’d wager as a conservative
estimate: <strong>{TT+, AQ+}</strong>. Let’s break the range down combinatorically:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 combos of TT</li>
<li>1 combo of JJ</li>
<li>6 combos of QQ</li>
<li>6 combos of KK</li>
<li>6 combos of AA</li>
<li>16 combos of AQ</li>
<li>16 combos of AK</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s ignore JJ since there’s only 1 combo, and it won’t have much effect on
our calculations. Let’s reduce the hand range to hands that we’re dominating,
hands that we’re flipping with, and hands that crush us:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 combos of hands we crush (TT)</li>
<li>32 combos of hands we’re flipping with (AQ, AK)</li>
<li>18 combos of hands that crush us (QQ, KK, AA)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pair-combos-to-known-equities"><a href="#pair-combos-to-known-equities" class="headerlink" title="Pair Combos to Known Equities"></a>Pair Combos to Known Equities</h2><p>We can simplify by cancelling out hands that we crush, and hands that crush us,
since they even out. Let’s get rid of TT and AA:</p>
<ul>
<li>32 combos of hands we’re flipping with (AQ, AK)</li>
<li>12 combos of hands that crush us (QQ, KK)</li>
</ul>
<p>For hands that we’re flipping with, we’re a 1.2:1 favorite (55%). For hands
that crush us, we’re a 4:1 dog (20%). In order to make this call profitable,
our hand equity must be better than our pot equity (2.2:1).</p>
<h2 id="combine-analysis"><a href="#combine-analysis" class="headerlink" title="Combine Analysis"></a>Combine Analysis</h2><p>Let’s calculate our hand equity. We do this by matching hands that we’re
flipping with, with hands that we crush. If we estimate that our equity when
we’re flipping is 50%, and our equity when we’re crushed is 0%, we can cancel
those equities to average out to ~25-30%.</p>
<ul>
<li>12 combos of hands that have ~30% equity.</li>
<li>20 combos of hands that have ~50% equity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s rough up the math. A third of the time, we will win a third of the time.
Two-thirds of the time, we will win half the time. So how often do we win
overall? Let’s just average it out:</p>
<ul>
<li>(12 <em> .30) + (20 </em> .50) / 32</li>
</ul>
<p>This yields 42.5% equity, giving us <strong>2.35:1 odds on our money</strong>. Since we’re
getting 2.2:1 odds on our call, <strong>calling is a profitable play</strong> in terms of
pure chip equity, although we’re not too excited by it.</p>
<h2 id="other-considerations"><a href="#other-considerations" class="headerlink" title="Other Considerations"></a>Other Considerations</h2><p>Although, there is the bubble factor. When we fold, we keep our percentage of
the prize pool equity, and when we lose, we lose it all. But considering we
were 3-4 spots away from small money, it might not be enough to sway our
decision.</p>
<p>There is also the skill factor. I had a large edge on the player pool, and I
could have passed up this spot and look for a better one later. I only had 2.2x
BB invested, although it was a seventh of my stack. That could have swayed my
decision.</p>
<p>He ended up showing QQ, which held.</p>
