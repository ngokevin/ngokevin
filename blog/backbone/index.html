  <meta property="og:description" content="This is a story of my Javascript image gallery, why I went with vanilla Javascript, the countless hours I put into it, and why I&#39;m rewriting it with Backbone.js and jQuery. The Javascript image gallery on my site has come a long way. Before I started working on it several months ago, I had little Javascript experience. I had only done a tiny jQuery-UI paginator and some exercises from Crockford&#39;s &#34;Javascript: The Good Parts&#34; and Eloquent Javascript. There were two motivations behind building my own image gallery. First, it would be cool and I could use it to post pictures to perhaps show my family what I&#39;ve been up to since I&#39;m all grown-up and rarely home. Secondly, I really needed to level up my Javascript skills Rocky-style before I headed down to Mozilla for a web development internship. What use is a web developer that doesn&#39;t know Javascript? I started the trek into what I called &#34;Javascript: The Final Frontier&#34;, a mission to explore Javascript, to seek out new technologies, and to go where most web devs have gone before. The gallery started out with pure vanilla white Javascript. I was aware of this library called jQuery, but I am stubborn and believed that was the easy way; I wanted to be &#34;hardcore&#34;, really get my hands dirty with the core of the language. Things definitely did get dirty. Fast-forward. After countless hours hacking on it and gaining experience (through pain) with Javascript, the image gallery and album viewer turned out great! Well, at least on the frontend. I felt the code got sort of messy. Sure, I had things pretty well modularized as best as I could, but there was no grand structure. Some of the logic got complicated especially when trying to resize images and center images; I had to know the size of the image before I could properly transform it, but I don&#39;t know the size until it is loaded into the DOM. There were became a lot of img.onload handlers. Then, I heard about Backbone.js from the mentor, thedjpetersen. He had been using it to help write his sleek persistent IRC web client Subway, which has exploded and gained quite a following. Backbone.js gives an MVC structure to web applications. Structure, you say? That&#39;s exactly what my gallery needed. I have just recently started to begin learning it. It provides a nice transition from vanilla Javascript to JQuery since I feel comfortable with Javascript now. Combine that with a Python Wok hook I wrote, which precalculates the image sizes and binds that data to the DOM, and the gallery which be much more shinier. On an off-note, I will try to make a blog post every day before I go to sleep. I had been spending an hour or two every night before sleep watching Netflix, but now I&#39;m trying to faze out all mindless entertainment and use that time instead for productive entertainment (blogging and hacking!)."/>
