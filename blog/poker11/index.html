  <h1>Poker Session Special - Recap and Vegas</h1>
  <p>24 Feb 2014</p>

  <p><a href="/blog/poker-live">Ten posts and three months ago</a>, I started a journey through
the live poker ranks of Portland. I have come a long way in a short time. With
the help of Harrington on Hold’em, I’m a different player than I
was from my online days, and it is with great providence that <strong>today</strong> was the
day Full Tilt released my funds of $85.51. As a way of the Poker Gods saying,
<em>from henceforth, you will begin anew, as a phoenix from the flames</em>. To
commemorate this multispecial day, I am taking the night off to recap my last
ten poker session posts, to reflect on how far I have come (so far) from the
online days, and to talk about the lost poker session of my time playing poker
in Las Vegas.</p>

<p>It’s the perfect time to do “administrative” work, meaning keep count
of numbers and such. To do so, I programmed a little chart that feeds off
a simple JSON array. I plan on extending this graph to include tooltips on
each plot to describe what the poker venue was (i.e Encore, Bellagio), to note
the buy-in and guarantee if it was a tournament, to show its profit, and to
include a link to its respective Poker Sessions blog post. By the numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Times Played:</strong> 24</li>
<li><strong>Total Profit:</strong> $1928</li>
<li><strong>ROI (Return on Investment):</strong> 275.43% ($700 to win $1928)</li>
<li><strong>Largest Cash:</strong> $888</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="/blog/poker">transition from online</a> to live poker was a godsend for me.
Although online poker was much more accessible, I believe it was a deterrent to my poker growth.
I would play thousands of online hands in an hour
whereas I might only play 50 live hands in the same amount of
time. Although that sounds great for online, the problem was that each mistake I made online became
lost in the sea of hands. When playing live, because the hands go by so slowly,
I recall a larger number of hands. Each mistake I make becomes magnified live.</p>
<p>So when I go home and blog about a session, I delibrately analyze and look into
each tough decision I face. This is an effective way to plug leaks. When I
adjust my game in this reflective manner, I am able to easily assimilate these
changes into my game for next session.</p>
<p>Online, I’d just play shitloads of hands and not review my hands afterwards.
Although I’d watch poker training videos, read forums and books, I didn’t
target or focus down on my mistakes like I do now.</p>
<p>Since I can only play one table, the hands go by slower, and it’s live, I now
am much better at gaining reads and exploiting individual opponents’
tendencies.  Online, I would use a HUD that would summarize every opponent in a
series of numbers (e.g. voluntary-put-in-pot-%, preflop-raise-%, 3-bet-%,
fold-to-cbet-%).  Combine that with playing 4-6 tables at once, and I ended up
playing on autopilot Although I did well in the microstakes (it was hard not
to), I had always felt plateaued.</p>
<h2 id="a-computer-science-education"><a href="#a-computer-science-education" class="headerlink" title="A Computer Science Education"></a>A Computer Science Education</h2><p>The difference between now and then was not only the transition to live poker,
but my college career in computer science. Back when I was a freshman computer
science student, I was pretty addicted to online poker. I did well in my
classes but brought my laptop to lectures to play poker (though not much
different from playing games on my phone in junior year and skipping classes
senior year). I was used to the high school life of
not-having-to-study-and-still-get-As.</p>
<p>But my journey through computer science has changed the way I learn.  Computer
science is a concept-oriented subject. It is best learned through application
(in most cases, programming) and not memorization.  I would watch poker videos
but not be able to effectively apply these concepts in practice. I would take
in concepts superficially and let them sit.</p>
<p>Computer science also taught me to learn iteratively. Like a for-loop or an
iterative-based software engineering model. Each session I find mistakes. Then
each hand review session I analyze and patch those mistakes. Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>I am improving each session by <strong>communicating</strong> and <strong>expressing my thought
process</strong> in the form of these Poker Session blog posts. Not only do I mature,
but I am able to look back, share, and also improve my writing.</p>
<h2 id="lost-vegas"><a href="#lost-vegas" class="headerlink" title="Lost Vegas"></a>Lost Vegas</h2><p>As a bonus, there was one poker session that I have yet to share: my trip to Vegas
during the winter break of 2013. Mozilla had given everyone time
off for the holidays allowing me to go on a carefree road trip with my
girlfriend. I had prepared by purchasing <em>Harrington on Hold’em Vol. 1</em>
from Powell’s City of Books that was across the street from the Mozilla office.
I think this trip to Vegas triggered something; it rebirthed and renewed my
interest in poker. To me, that book purchase was a PTSD flashback. I was a
relapsing 4-year-clean junkie.</p>
<p>I played at four casinos in Vegas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bellagio</li>
<li>The Luxor</li>
<li>The Wynn</li>
<li>The Venetian</li>
</ul>

<p>Christmas Day. I had been reading my Harrington book in the van on the drive
from LA. It was all coming back. Cbets, board textures, double barrels, ranges.
But I was rusty.</p>
<p>We arrived at the Bellagio where I signed up for $1/$3 no-limit hold’em. There
was a wait list so I picked up a <em>Poker Player</em> magazine and sat to read at a
video poker machine. <em>“Kevin!”</em>, my name was called. I grabbed my $200 in chips
and headed to a table. I sat to the left of an old Asian tourist and to the
right of a Russian-looking baldie.</p>
<p>As a funny strategy, I had my girlfriend sitting behind me so I could like an
Asian tourist fish.</p>
<p>After about half an hour of play, I was up about $30 largely due to a
successful cbet and a successful double-barrel bluff on a paired turn.
Hit and run.</p>
<h3 id="the-luxor"><a href="#the-luxor" class="headerlink" title="The Luxor"></a>The Luxor</h3><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/DloUMdJ.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Later around midnight, my girlfriend and I went back to the Luxor, our
Egyptian-themed pyramid hotel, to find her dad and uncle. They had been eyeing
the poker table that morning but against my good advice, the uncle was sat at a
poker table. He was free money if I ever saw it, and indeed he was stuck a
buy-in.</p>
<p>They persuaded me to play so they could watch and learn, offering to stake for
50% of the earnings and 50% of the losses, though I didn’t need the stake.
I didn’t want to play at midnight, but I sat at the Luxor tables anyways.</p>
<p>I had been enticed by two Chinese tourist girls sharing a seat and a couple of
old Asian guys. My bumhunting targets are old people, Asians, and
tourists. They matched all of the above. Unfortunately the girls were felted
before I got to sit.</p>
<p>Whiel I played, the uncle was walking around the table, awkwardly standing
crotch-to-back behind other players, to which someone remarked.</p>
<p><em>“can we get this guy a bit farther from me? He makes me uncomfortable. He’s a
lurker, you know?”</em></p>
<p>Came in a couple of locals, and the table dried out pretty quickly. I managed
to make about $25 after another half hour, mostly from one 3bet/cbet bluff. We
exchanged Christmas presents in the hotel room and ended the day.</p>

<p>To put it short, I did not win at the Wynn. We were north the strip since my
girlfriend had childhood connections to get us free tickets to the normally-$50
Wynn Christmas-time buffet. While we were there, I sat for some more.</p>
<p>Although it started off swell, it didn’t end as well. I paid off a guy with top
pair and was rivered by another guy for a cooler. After an hour and a half, I
was stuck a buy-in. But the night was young for redemption.</p>

</span></div>

<p>We were exploring the decor of the famous casinos and hotels as we walked our
way back to the Luxor on the other end of the strip. I heard about
Venice-themed Venetian, how it might have been soft. We walked past the indoor
water canal with the sky-painted ceilings, down the stairs to have one final go
on our last night of Vegas.</p>
<p>I doubled up with queens within the first few hands to recoup the buy-in. There
were rich middle-eastern businessmen tourists on my left and right. Good seat
for a good recovery.</p>
<p>About $40 up coming out of Vegas. Though the amount wasn’t important, it was
the spur of my poker addiction for the next few months that became the takeaway
from this experience. Though the money is sometimes nice too…</p>
