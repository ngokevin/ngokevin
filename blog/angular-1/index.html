  <meta property="og:description" content="Welcome to my five-part introduction to AngularJS! Because I was dissatisfied with the incoherency of the official AngularJS docs. I started writing this AngularJS guide on weekends during my senior year in college. But since starting full-time at Mozilla, my motivation and energy waned. So I am publishing it on my blog for the good of The Web! This introduction comes complete with live demos and open-sourced examples. Table of Contents ch.1 - AngularJS ch.2 - Scopes ch.3 - Controllers ch.4 - Templates ch.5 - Forms Directives Unit Testing AngularJS AngularJS, or Angular, is a model-view-controller (MVC) client-side Javascript (JS) application framework that features two-way data binding and enhances HTML to be more declarative, expressive, and dynamic-friendly. Let us get some prerequisite concepts out of the way before we dive into hello- worldish code. MVC MVC is a development pattern (or paradigm, if you will) that revolves around a separation of concerns. I will describe MVC and then apply its concepts to Angular. The model holds the data and state. The view is what the user sees. The controller is the glue between the model and view. They connect together. The model powers everything in the background with its data, though is aware of only itself. The view polls the model for its current state. Interactions in the view are recognized by the controller to update the model. An analogy might be a photographer holding a photoshoot with a supermodel. The supermodel&#39;s pose is the current state. The photographer views the supermodel through the camera lens. The photographer directs the supermodel to change poses. Angular&#39;s development pattern is MVC, and Angular strictly adheres to this separation of concerns. Though in Angular jargon, it is employed more like scope-template-controller. Worry not, these concepts will be explained once you are ready, young padawan. Until these concepts are presented properly, we will still refer to MVC components as model-view-controller. Two-Way Data Binding Remember when I mentioned that the model&#39;s state is pushed to the view. Well, Angular features two-way data binding. Not only does the view update whenever the model changes, but changes to the view automatically updates back to the model. This is powerful. It permits us to write less middleman code between the model and view. Instead we let the model and view go outside and play with each other, no supervision needed. Referring to our earlier analogy, it would be as if the photographer struck the same poses in sync with the supermodel. This saves a lot of trouble by eliminating manual DOM manipulation. I was once writing an non-Angular web app. It had an ugly function that synced my model with my view via large block of jQuery code. Every time the user interacted with the page, I had to call that expensive block of jQuery code to update the page. I was displeased by this. Thus, I turned to Angular for its two-way data binding. Client-Side Templating Though, the two-way data binding does not happen without a little push. We need to hook things together from the client-side template. Client-side templates are usually HTML files that are augmented to be more dynamic. They are often sprinkled with traditional control structures such as loops and conditionals. And they contain placeholders that represent specified variables. If you are familiar with server-side web framework templating, it is just that but on the client and, in our case, manipulated via JS. Angular templates are a special flavor of templates. Along with control structures and variable placeholders, they are also capable of declaring two- way data bindings and event handlers. In our next example Invitation to Angular, we will get a first glimpse at some Angular. Example In Invitation to Angular, we will sync an HTML text input element with a p element to demonstrate two-way data binding. &lt;!doctype html&gt; &lt;html ng-app&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;script src=&#34;../lib/js/angular.min.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Invitation to Angular&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;input type=&#34;text&#34; ng-model=&#34;mySpecies&#34; placeholder=&#34;What is your species?&#34;&gt; &lt;p&gt; It is a great honor to bask in the presence of a {{ mySpecies || &#39;human&#39; }}. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Angular humbly welcomes you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; ngApp bootstraps the our document to Angular, and we have the input binded to a model variable species via the ngModel directive. All we need to know about directives, for now, is that they allow us to register behavior to the document object model (DOM), the browser&#39;s representation of HTML. Note when a directive&#39;s name is used as an HTML attribute such as in Baby Example, it is spelled with a hyphen (e.g. ng-app). However, the canonical name for directives in Angular is spelled with camel case (e.g. ngApp). Now back to the example, the input will read human by default if mySpecies is not set. We accomplish this with an Angular expression in the variable placeholder, {{ mySpecies || &#39;human&#39; }}. An expression is like inline code in the template that Angular evaluates. Say we type &#34;cyberman&#34; into the input box. species&#39;s value in the backend will automatically update to &#34;cyberman&#34; as we type. Since we have species under two-way data binding, no onchange event handlers are required. Up Next With some concepts on our belt and a sneak peek at Angular in action, we will take a deeper gander at the model side of Angular, the scope, in ch.2 Scopes."/>

<p>In <em>Invitation to Angular</em>, we will sync an HTML text input element with a

    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
      It is a great honor to bask
      in the presence of a {{ mySpecies || &#39;human&#39; }}.
    <span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Angular humbly welcomes you.<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

<p><code>ngApp</code> bootstraps the our document to Angular, and we have the input
binded to a model variable species via the <code>ngModel</code> <strong>directive</strong>.
All we need to know about directives, for now, is that they allow us to
register behavior to the document object model (DOM), the browser's

<p>Note when a directive's name is used as an HTML attribute such as in <em>Baby

canonical name for directives in Angular is spelled with camel case (e.g.

<p>Now back to the example, the input will read <em>human</em> by default if
<code>mySpecies</code> is not set. We accomplish this with an Angular <strong>expression</strong>
in the variable placeholder, <code>{{ mySpecies || 'human' }}</code>. An expression is
like inline code in the template that Angular evaluates.</p>
<p>Say we type "cyberman" into the input box. <code>species</code>'s value in the
backend will automatically update to "cyberman" as we type. Since we have
<code>species</code> under two-way data binding, no <code>onchange</code> event handlers are
required.</p>
