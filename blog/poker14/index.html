  <p>Some money to throw around and a Saturday to kill after a <a href="/blog/poker13">$1064
finish</a> on Friday night. Unfortunately, after getting home at
4am, I was not able to wake up for my favorite 11am freeroll. Getting up at 1pm
though was good enough. I again took first place in the $960-pot freeroll for a
$360 finish. Looking back on my stats over six freeroll tournaments, I have a
<strong>740% ROI</strong> ($150 to earn $1260).</p>

<ul>
<li>1/25/14: 1st for $355</li>
<li>1/25/14: 1st for $235</li>
<li>2/02/01: Bust for $0 (straight over straight cooler)</li>
<li>2/22/14: Three way chop for $220</li>
<li>2/22/14: 3rd for $90</li>

</ul>
<p>A freeroll is a tournament where the buyin is free and the house guarantees
(spots) the prize pool. At the Final Table, they spot $300.  Though players put
in enough money through rebuys and addons such that the prize pool is no longer
guaranteed by the house but by the players.</p>
<p>The concept of a <strong>free</strong>roll and house guarantee allures other players to come
play wild and loose, <em>“my buyin is free, and rebuys are only $15!”</em>. Rather
than thinking the tourney is free, it is advantageous to pay for a full stack
to maximize the ability to win large pots from players that come on top of the
early stage donkfest. I just think of it as a $30 turbo ($15 pre-addon, $15
addon) against shortstacks. A turbo tournament is a game in which the blinds
raise a very quick pace (every 12 minutes).</p>
<p>Why are these freerolls so easy? Players are very loose since it’s a freeroll.
Limping, chasing, shoving preflop with marginal hands. There is a donkfest at
the beginning where some players come out with a large stack, and it is easy to
longball for a good stack yourself. But ironically the key to winning these
freerolls is not winning huge pots, but rather stack awareness.</p>
<h3 id="stack-awareness"><a href="#stack-awareness" class="headerlink" title="Stack Awareness"></a>Stack Awareness</h3><p>Leading us to the second reason, that other players do not have stack awareness
during these turbos. Players do not adjust to the large blinds and think of
their stack in an absolute rather than a relative perspective. A player with a
chip lead might think they are healthy because they have more chips than
everyone else, but if the blinds are high relative to their stack, they
actually should be feeling desparate and be making moves.</p>
<p>Winning these freerolls are all about recognizing your “M-ratio”, or the number
of rounds you can survive before being blinded out. Once my M-ratio falls below
6, which happens pretty quickly to everyone, I make a lot of moves. I shove
wide into unopened or limped pots in late position to pick up the dead money,
and if I am called I still have a chance to win. It is about combining fold
equity with pot equity to steal tons of blinds to quickly replenish and build a
stack. Each successful steal can increase your stack by 20%. In the off-chance
you get called, your cards are still live.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I have reads on several players that frequent the weekends
that give me information in determining the timing of my pushes.</p>
<h2 id="5pm-300-freeroll-1st-place-for-360"><a href="#5pm-300-freeroll-1st-place-for-360" class="headerlink" title="5pm $300 Freeroll - 1st Place for $360"></a>5pm $300 Freeroll - 1st Place for $360</h2><p>At the final table, a guy named loose-passive Asian gambler named Raj was on my
immediate left. We went at it a lot in blind vs blind battles. I had earlier
shoved his limp with T8s to double up. He limped into my BB, I shove, he
folded. I win a three-way all-in after shoving with K3o for king high.</p>
<p>Raj min-raises my BB, and stop-and-go’ed a 774 flop with 26s. An messy lookin’
obnoxious middle-aged woman (call her Hags) <em>intelligently</em> remarked, <em>“hey, if
you shoved preflop, he would have folded!”</em>. No shit, Sherlock, I will remember
to soulread his cards from now on. Thankfully, she busted out soon after.</p>
<p>We went to break with four players left. I was the shortest stack, but with
these blinds, stack size did not matter. I came back from the break aggressive
and firing, going all-in four hands in a row. Players were way too tight, and
with the steals, I commanded the chip lead. I lost a flip a soon after to
become short stack again, but kept up the aggression and stole more pots.</p>
<p>Raj limped into my BB, I shove with KK, he calls with ATo to bust. He probably
should have accepted the chop were negotiating earlier. It was down to heads up
with me and an old Viet-looking guy (call him Phet). He was very short stacked.
I tell him <em>“I’m probably going to shove with my next hand with any two
cards”</em>. I shove with A6o, and it holds against QTo to win the tournament.</p>
<p>I remember to tip the dealers well with this time, 11%.</p>
<h2 id="3pm-25-freezeout-busted"><a href="#3pm-25-freezeout-busted" class="headerlink" title="3pm $25 Freezeout - Busted"></a>3pm $25 Freezeout - Busted</h2><p>It was fun and games at this table. Unfortunately, I lost a AK vs TT flip, and
did a loose isolation to get it all in against two players with an open-ended
straight draw and overcard. Hags kept talking obnoxiously to me about hands I
really couldn’t care about if I tried. I hate single-table SNGs and without the
guarantee, the prize pool was as weak as Monday to Friday.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Went Well:</strong> final table and shove-fold play</li>
<li><strong>Mistakes:</strong> a bit of a spew after losing a flip and making too loose of an iso with A4o</li>
<li><strong>Get Better At</strong>: determining who, when, and with what to iso. Think about making a notebook
on player profiles since I regularly play the same faces</li>
<li><strong>Profit</strong>: +$305</li>
</ul>
