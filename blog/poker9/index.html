  <meta property="og:description" content="Final Table, slowly growing on me as my favorite poker joint for its softness, held a Friday night $10K double-guarantee, meaning the house chips into the prize pool if there is not money from the players to match $10K. But enough flocked to make it $15K. There were 180 runners, and after six hours of play, I was knocked out around 28th place. This is called bubbling, when someone is knocked out right before the money. Though I had to do the walk of shame empty-handed at midnight, I became acquaintances with a pro. I find as I play more and more, I&#39;m starting to get to know some people around town. 6pm $10000 Guaranteed - Busted on the Bubble After talking about a hand about punishing limpers (putting in a big raise to earn the dead money in the middle from people calling preflop with weak hands), a girl on my right and I started talking a bit about poker backgrounds. Though I play on the side, she plays full-time for a living, completely crushing the game. With her from a psychology/accounting background and me from a computer science background, we figured we might be able to learn off of each other so we exchanged contact information to meet up sometime and maybe play a home game. There was a dealer who randomly guessed my name correctly from my looks. Analyzing the Re-Steal Though she knocked me out when I attempted a resteal from the big blind. She was on the button and put in a raise of 3.2x the big blind, which is pretty large at the late stages of a tournament. Since the button can raise with a pretty wide range, I opted to shove with 34s for 3x the raise since I needed to make a move soon with my short stack. Unfortunately, she had a good holding of AJo. Which isn&#39;t too bad considering I&#39;m getting my money in 40/60, but I could definitely have chosen a better spot with someone else. At least I could have done a stop and go. I had plenty of chips for fold equity. She went on to win the tournament for $4K. First-In Vigorish What I need to be strict on when contemplating a shove in the late stages of a tourney is first-in vigorish. That means raising when folded to you which is advantageous because players after need a better hand to call than to raise themselves (related to the gap concept). Whomever bets first gets it. A resteal might have been okay against a reg like her but I should have targeted the other fish who generally aren&#39;t great at adjusting to late stages. I went home and stayed up until 6am working on Sriracha, getting ready to play again on Saturday. Session Conclusion Went Well: reading and targeting fish, laying down TT against TAG UTG raiser late Mistakes: preflop range a bit tight in late stages, attempting a resteal when fold equity wasn&#39;t there Get Better At: timing moves Profit: -$80"/>
