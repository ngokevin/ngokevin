  <meta property="og:description" content="After heading to bed at 6am, I got up at 10:30am to play at the Final Table, a 30-second drive away. I played two of the turbo freeroll tournaments against familiar faces final table play was fucking amazing during the first tournament but had a couple of hiccups during the second. I chopped for first place in the first tournament for $220 and finished third in the second tournament for $90. With pressure from my mom and girlfriend, I gave my mom $100 for her to donate to the impoverished in Vietnam. Thus I nick myself today as Robin Hood, taking from the fish and giving to the poor. 11am Freeroll - Three-Way Chop for $220 Let&#39;s just skip to the final table where I just had my way over everyone especially during the bububble. I recognized my M-ratio and took advantage of all of my favorable first-in vigorish situations to pick up dead chips. As always, I love punishing limpers from the blinds with shoves. Fish never recognize how wide you&#39;re shoving. After a while, I accumulated a large stack. A note to myself, that female-Scotty-Nguyen-wannabe is a huge aggrodonk. Unfortunately, my KK got cracked in a three-way pot against 44 vs JJ where a reg spiked a 4. I built it back up but this hand was actually somewhat beneficial since it was the first hand I showed down after shoving a lot. People gave me even more credit later. Every time I shoved with face-rag, I showed the face and got tons of respect. For instance, I shoved with K3o, showed the K, and got put on KK/KQ. The reg who spiked a 4 built up a decent stack. He was a cool guy who complimented my game and shove timings. We talked a lot of about push/shove odds with the blind levels. It got down 3 way where I lost four 40/60s in a row. My chip lead dwindled to average until we were all about even. Unfortunate since I was a favorite to take it all down. Since the blinds were so large, it became a shove-fest so we negotiated a chop. I shot the shit with the reg outside, I kind of wanted to learn more about him but I went home to come back later for the next freeroll. 5pm Freeroll - Third Place for $90 Chicago (whom you may know from my previous posts) was in this one. I love playing against him since I target him every tournament. He&#39;s an aggrodonk so I just tighten up and value-bet away. Though he gave me trouble in a couple of hands, and he was running super red hot. He went to win the freeroll, which is great because it&#39;ll encourage him to play more. He won two flips to knock me out. But I want to talk about several different hands with Chicago. Facing a Donk Shove with Top Pair Okay Kicker I isolate two limpers on the button with A8o. Chicago calls from the BB and the limpers fold. Flop comes 49A two-tone. Chicago open-shoves. I tank. Chicago loves playing any Ax, he&#39;ll never fold them. So A9/A4 does this as well as possibly any set. He doesn&#39;t need to slowplay because I already represent a high-ace hand with my large raise preflop. I saw this as trying to get value by representing a bluff, but I know he doesn&#39;t bluff here. I fold and he shows 49o. I adjust his calling range to any two cards when the blinds are low. Facing a UTG 4-Bet with AK Chicago raises 3x UTG. I 3bet from the big blind with AKo. He 4bet snap-shoves. This is pretty standard. His range is a bit wider so I can say {JJ+, AQ+}. Since I have blockers to aces and kings, it&#39;s an okay call online but I expect to run into AA a lot here. Generally live, I should weigh snap shoves more towards AA and pick a better spot but I called since I had a rebuy. His AA holds. I get my chips back from him next hand when I squeeze-shove AQ from the SB. Facing a Turn Shove on TQKx Board with AK Chicago raises UTG during the final table with two callers. Since I had just seen him raise UTG with AA, my mind might have been a bit scared. I should 3bet squeeze here since it&#39;s good against his UTG range is {88+, any two broadways}. But I made the mistake of smooth calling instead of 3bet squeezing after having just ran into the top end of his range. Board comes TQKr. Chicago cbets, I smooth call again, hoping to further induce if he&#39;s bluffing. However I called planning ahead for the turn. Chicago shoves the blank turn to cover me. I tank. Since his UTG range was high pairs and two-broadways, his range on the turn here consists of a lot of straights, sets, and two pair. Although my top pair top kicker was a good hand, I don&#39;t see a bluff here after my call. I hadn&#39;t invested too many chips and I thought I could find a better spot than this. I fold, and Chicago shows K5o. That was definitely not in my perception of his UTG range, but I still think it was a good fold. Session Conclusion I seem to do pretty well in these turbo freerolls. They&#39;re soft like Downy. Went Well: exceptional preflop final table play, turn/river double barrel bluffs Mistakes: times I 3xed rather than shoved, putting myself into difficult spots on the flop. Get Better At: not being a pussy with AKo Profit: +$235"/>
