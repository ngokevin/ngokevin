  <meta property="og:description" content="Alright, shake it off. After a long day of bug squashing at work, I came in ready to go for a Tuesday night at the Encore. In the hunt for fish, I&#39;m served only shrimp as Encore&#39;s competition could swim twice as fast as that of Final Table&#39;s. Stiffer players that night but all men are only human, and any human could be leveled. In response, I leveled up my game, paying extra attention, and was able to obtain accurate reads. Vegeta, what does the scouter say? As for the title, I oddly got remarks from several players (including a very drunk birthday girl) that I looked like the Asian guy from &#39;The Internship&#39;. The one with Owen Wilson as a Google intern. I haven&#39;t seen it as it&#39;s yet another shitty comedy. The actor in question is Tobit Raphael. I admit, there&#39;s a hint of resemblance, especially considering I was a Mountain View intern. Encore Club 8pm $1500 Guaranteed - Busted on the Bubble Everyone was playing pretty tight preflop which put me on alert. This game was a bit tougher than Final Table&#39;s pool where there are frequent limp-calls with trashy hands. But you can&#39;t play poker without thinking you&#39;re the best at the table. So I stepped it up and started classifying players into three player types. Loose-passive: calls a lot, wants to get to showdown Aggrodonk: bets a lot, wants everyone to fold Weak-tight: folds a lot, wants to only play the nuts I watched what players did and tipped them towards a certain player type until proven wrong. There was a player on my right in a hoodie who looked like someone one of my college CS Operating Systems class. I thought was loose-passive since he was limp-calling a lot preflop, but I was able to steal his blinds and cbet him off the flop with extreme ease, changing my perception of him towards weak-tight. There was a player on my left with a backwards gray cap and earbuds. I watched him be aggressive postflop, betting with marginal hands or air. So I adjusted. I checked with top pair for deception (risking the draw) in hopes the aggressive small blind would bet. Unfortunately on the turn, the T puts too many draws out there so I raise. When villain calls, I don&#39;t see in getting any more value on the river with TPNK. Hero (BTN): Healthy stack Villain (BB): Healthy stack Pre Flop: Hero is BTN with K4o Hero raises to 3xBB, Villain calls. Flop: KQ2r Villain checks, Hero checks. Turn: T Villain bets 3/4 pot, Hero raises 3x bet, Villain calls. River: 7 Villain checks. Hero checks. Hero shows K4o SB shows ATo I played pretty perfectly the whole night, making it to the final table in the 40-runner tournament. But I only won 1 flip out of 3 (88 vs QK, AK vs AK vs 33, A2 vs QK). And when you can&#39;t win flips, you lose. Session Conclusion Went Well: punishing the limpers with all-ins from the BB Mistakes: attempting a loose iso/steal with 2 limpers with J9s on the button with a yellow stack. SB woke up with AA. Okay move, but I can choose better spots Get Better At: further develop classifying players Profit: -$60"/>
