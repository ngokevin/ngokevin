  <h1>Nabbing an Internship at Mozilla</h1>
  <p>9 Nov 2011</p>

  <p>Only two weeks ago, I was at <a href="http://ngokevin.com/blog/recap:-beaver-bar-camp-8/index.html">Beaver
Barcamp</a> talking
to a recruiter about applying for an internship at open source giant,
<a href="http://mozilla.org" target="_blank" rel="external">Mozilla</a>. I figured I had a bit of a chance of getting
accepted so what the hell, I went for it. I quickly whipped up a resume on the
spot, said I was interested in web development and security, had a chat, and
then I went on my merry way.</p>
<hr>
<p>If I were to go into web development, I had to learn some Javascript so I spent
the weekend working on the <a href="http://lug.oregonstate.edu" target="_blank" rel="external">OSULUG website</a>,
revamping it with some jQuery. I then sent in my resume again via email and got
was shortly scheduled an interview the following day. The interview was in a
few days so I decided to crack out on some web development material, namely
Javascript and web security and scalability. I went into Mozilla mode and
diverted a good portion of my attention away from school.</p>
<p>I had my first phone screen with web-dev at Mozilla working on
<a href="http://support.mozilla.org" target="_blank" rel="external">SUMO</a>. The interview itself went largely well,
except I was at work at the time and couldn’t really find a quiet spot.
I initially sat in front of an elevator on a high floor, but got kicked out
by a receptionist. I talked about my projects and asked about their workflow
which was somewhat familiar (branch, review, stage, deploy). He was really nice
and thankfully asked questions that I could answer. Soon after the interview, I
found out I got made it through and had two more scheduled for the next
week…on the same day.</p>
<p>This gave me time to tend to my <a href="http://ngokevin.com/blog/web-server-back-up/index.html">DDoSed
Webserver</a> and get my
website set back up again. I spent a large part of the weekend rebuilding my
website using <a href="http://github.com/mythmon/wok" target="_blank" rel="external">Wok</a> rather than Django as I had
no need for a nonstatic website and didn’t have time to roll my own CMS.</p>
<p>My second interview was on a Monday noon with another web-dev who manages
<a href="http://support.mozilla.com" target="_blank" rel="external">SuMo</a>. I wasn’t quite awake all the way, got a bit
nervous during the call, and was talking a bit fast throwing in some “uhm”s a
bit too often. At least this time, I was in a nice quiet spot in my aparmtent,
though it may have been too quiet.  After a bit I slowed myself down and
answered questions about web scalability and security. After the interview I
headed out to work.</p>
<p>My last interview was several hours later with the director of web development
(who actually used to work at OSU). I got home to my apartment, but there wasn’t
a private place to hold a phone conversation…so I had the bright idea to do
it in my car in the parking lot. So I sat in my car around the time of the
interview. I sat there for about fifteen minutes staring at my phone until the
call came. This time the conversation was less of an interview and more of a
chat. I told him what kind of projects I would be interested in (more frontend
stuff since I suck at that) and learned what the internship would be like. By
this time, I was told my chances were looking good as they received a lot of
applications and only talked to a few and that they would take several.</p>
<p>The following day while checking my email as I normally do every few seconds, I
received an offer from Mozilla! I gave fridgei a high-five and obviously
accepted. I would then start the process of dropping out of MECOP. What a
relief, I was not excited to work in Windows, .NET frameworks or QAing home
security lock software.</p>
<p>Today, I received a call from the recruiters who had been helping getting my
availability and scheduling my interviews, about the internship.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Five months in Mountain View, California</p>
</li>
<li><p>Free transportation, housing, and laptop</p>
</li>
<li><p>All of the fun stuff at Mozilla and Mountain View</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m pretty excited. I’ll be surrounded by intelligent people, the work I will
do there would make my current work look trivial, I get to work on a
large-scale open source project, and of course the place is a stone’s throw
from the bay. Until then, I’m going to try to get <strong>a lot</strong> better at web
development, specifically Javascript so I adapt in smoothly . Can’t wait, and
throughout the whole interview process everyone was really nice. Thanks to
everyone I talked to and Mozilla!</p>
