              <p>I'm working on submission and reviewer tools for FirefoxOS add-ons, which I'd
like to shout out is the most exciting thing to hit FirefoxOS yet. It'll enable
a customization community as powerful as CyanogenMod yet be much more
accessible.</p>
<p>For this project, I wanted to port our Flux framework from
<a href="http://acdlite.github.io/flummox">Flummox</a> to
<a href="http://rackt.github.io/redux/docs/introduction/index.html">Redux</a> while using
<a href="https://github.com/rackt/react-router/">react-router</a>. I always struggle with
getting react-router to pass Redux-related context to the handler components.
Having done this twice and running into many pitfalls, I am sharing my
experiences to prospective struggle-bus riders.</p>

              <p>Two years out of university, and my money is rotting in the bank through
inflation. Money that could instead be be put to long-term investment to grow.
At the beginning of the year, I was merely maxing my traditional 401K.  That
was easy since I simply had to plug in a percentage of my income through
<a href="http://401k.fidelity.com">Fidelity</a>. Though I could have stood to diversify
and put in more. With <a href="http://reddit.com/r/personalfinance">/r/personalfinance</a>
as a jumping off point, my finances and portfolio have come a long way. Here's
how.</p>

              <p>Another Warriors WCF game, another night at the poker club. I had to wait over
an hour for a seat yet again, but worth. Got a seat in a five-handed game, and
we chopped the blinds five hands in a row. I knew this was going to be an
extremely tight table, especially with everyone distracted with the game and
autopiloting. Heck, it took everyone ten seconds every hand to look at their
cards since their attention was to the screens. So I let loose and took down
the blinds ($7) nearly every hand. I never lost a pot I was involved in, and
eventually walked away <strong>+$180</strong> after less than an hour. And Warriors won,
good night.</p>

              <p>Achievement unlocked! $5000 profit logged since playing live poker. A grindy
<strong>+$130</strong> session put me over the line as I controlled a four-handed table.
Now I look at getting to $10K, and hopefully reaching there within half a year.
I'm playing nightly after work, and it's healthy; it keeps me from burning out,
and it gives me a reason to code something I need. So here comes another
session of blogging. The only reason why I'm writing this post now and not
playing is there weren't enough runners at 10pm at the club tonight.</p>
<p>Let me take a second to do a little dance: I've played 95 poker sessions (a
tournament or cash game sitting), made $15K revenue with $10K investment,
totaling out to $5K.</p>

              <p>Return of the <a href="http://petes881club.com/">Pete's 881 Club</a>. The poker addiction
is Sidious. Last Friday after a night at Off the Grid, I went down <strong>-$110</strong> in
a 2/5NL cash game, a case of card-dead, but I lost the minimum, and it could
have gone worse. Then on Sunday I played a deepstack tourney and dropped my
<strong>-$120</strong> buy-in, I was playing close-to-perfect but got sucked out on after
someone tried a stop-and-go bluff. Tonight, I went up a <strong>+$500</strong> buy-in in
about an hour in the 2/5NL cash game. I admit I ran a little hot, but I'll take
it as a reward for enduring the cold. And as usual, I always blog after a good
night while ignoring the bad ones.</p>
<p>I walked into Pete's, an older Vietnamese regular yelled "ah, you go to school,
then come here?" as I had my backpack. I had brought my laptop to work while I
was waiting for a seat. The waitress also IDed me. #curryface.</p>
