              <p>Last weekend, I built a site for a new club on campus as my first freelance gig
(though I also handled the domain name and hosting). For the past couple
months, I have been a little interested in visual design and user
experience. This design exhibits some tricks I picked up and often use make
things look pretty. I dub this plastic surgery, as it is a quick and simple
path to beautification.</p>

page</a>, creates a tightly-coded random
painting using HTML5's Canvas. The cool part is that it draws before your eyes,
starting from a blank canvas to a simple landscape with a pretty tree.
Currently, it draws trees and mountains along with the ground and sky. I am
happy with where it is at for now, though it could use some happy little
clouds.</p>
<p>I named it Gogh since I had a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/WQajm.jpg">Doctor Who poster</a>
in my room drawn in the style of Gogh's Starry Night Sky, though I dedicated it
to the late Bob Ross, whom I grew up watching since he was on after the cooking
show and before Sesame Street. My motivation was to scratch my itch for some
Canvas and trigonometry. Gogh try it out at the link above..</p>

              <p>At <a href="http://lug.oregonstate.edu/blog/bbcx">Beaver Bar Camp X</a>, I gave a talk on
the theory of poker and hold'em strategy. The slides were intended to skim the
iceberg of a professional poker player's mindset. Though I'll skim over what I
talked about here.</p>
<h3 id="my-poker-career-in-a-nutshell">My Poker Career in a Nutshell</h3>
<p>I first started playing online poker seriously on Pokerstars sometime during my
freshman year of college. Attracted by those endless promotions poker rooms
have, my first deposit into Pokerstars was $20. I read books, dove into forums,
did the math, paid for coaching videos, studied the game as if it were for my
computer science degree.</p>
<p>I began to beat the microstakes (2NL 6max) at a hot rate of 20 big blinds per
100 hands over several tens of thousands of hands. I played 4 tables at a time,
and played at least 4 hours a day.  I moved onto 5NL on Full Tilt where I kept
beating the game, then went through a long downswing, though still up. I tried
my hand at a bit of heads-up; it wasn't my thing.  The US Department of Justice
eventually seized Poker Stars and Full Tilt on what was deemed "Black Friday".
That was the end of ...

              <p>Last month, I stayed up for over 24 hours straight for a Yahoo! hackathon where
I spawned <a href="http://grandbox.ngokevin.com">Grandbox</a>, an HTML5 Box2DWeb-powered
physics sandbox game. The goal was to create a side-scrolling platform game
where players could create their levels, and the idea was inspired by the video
games, LittleBigPlanet (a side-scrolling platformer where players create and
share levels) and Garry's Mod (a physics sandbox game). I wanted to learn what
it was somewhat like to create a game, even though I relied upon a Javascript
library to do a lot of the thinking for me. Since it's a web application and
therefore cross-platform, people could create levels on the desktop and play
them on mobile. Though I haven't gotten quite that far.</p>
<h3 id="the-features">The Features</h3>
<p>After hacking for 24 hours solo, I got Grandbox to a presentable state that I
was quite proud of. It currently has a sandbox mode where you control little
pink ball that can roll around and jump. On the sidebar, there are objects that
you can add to the world that interact with the player and other objects. I
implemented a handful of objects such as balls, boxes, platforms, ...
